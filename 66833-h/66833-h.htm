<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>TRANTER
SALLY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wayside hedgerow, gay with its
autumn tints, stretched its undulating length beside the rather
stony lane that wound upwards from the high road, and lost itself
amid a multiplicity of sheep-tracks on the down.</p>
<p>It was one of those mild days that here in the south country
cheat the fancy with their likeness, not merely to spring, but to
summer.&nbsp; The sky was blue and cloudless; the birds were
singing; the banks were still starred with many flowers:
crane&rsquo;s-bill, mallow and scabious.&nbsp; Here and there the
gorse was blooming afresh, and new blossoms of guelder-rose
surmounted, incongruously enough, twigs with claret-coloured
leaves that dropped at a touch.&nbsp; Here, indeed, the finger of
autumn had left its trace, and all along the hedge were tokens of
its magic.&nbsp; Such miracles of colour as the conjurer had
wrought this year are rarely to be seen: such goldens and ambers,
such scarlets and crimsons; stretching away beyond the hedge were
fields still silvery with night-dews, and woods shining with the
incomparable burnish of the season.</p>
<p>Sol Bowditch, the hedger, had no eyes for any of these
beauties, however; under the strokes of that <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>uncompromising
bill-hook of his the glories of the hedge were shorn.&nbsp;
Bending his vigorous young body backwards, he threw all his
strength into the task, and with each rhythmical swing of his
sturdy arm a fresh victim fell.&nbsp; Now a branch of maple that
seemed to shower stars as it dropped; now a jagged wild-rose,
heavily laden with ruby provender which later on might have made
many a starving bird happy; now a hazel-twig with a few belated
nuts still clinging to their shrivelled wrappings; now, with
quick sharp strokes, making short work of hawthorn and privet;
again tearing, rather than cutting with his hook, long-tufted
tendrils of jewelled bryony or hoary traveller&rsquo;s-joy.</p>
<p>Thus was beauty laid low and nature&rsquo;s kindly forethought
set at nought.&nbsp; Farmer House cared little for the poetical
aspect of things, and still less for the wants of the
singing-birds; being apt, indeed, to speak of all wild creatures
in a lump as &ldquo;dratted varmint.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was Sol
Bowditch&rsquo;s duty to please Farmer House, and so between them
the birds&rsquo; winter store was trampled under foot or
scattered to the winds.</p>
<p>Sol Bowditch was a stranger, having recently tramped hither
all the way from Bridport in search of work; but though he had
travelled on foot and carried his worldly goods in a small
bundle, he was unquestionably an honest and respectable young
fellow.&nbsp; No one who looked at his brown face and clear eyes
could doubt that fact, and as for the manner in which he wielded
his bill-hook it was, as the farmer said, a treat to see him.</p>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>It wanted
yet an hour or two of dinner-time when Sol, having paused a
moment to finish tearing away an obstinate tangle of bryony, was
startled by the approaching sound of wheels; and, looking up, saw
the rim of the green hood of a carrier&rsquo;s cart slowly
rounding the corner of the lane from the point where it descended
from the down.&nbsp; The horse was apparently very old, for it
proceeded slowly; and the vehicle creaked and jolted as if it too
were ancient.&nbsp; As it jogged nearer Sol saw that it contained
but a single occupant, that of the girl-driver, and when it came
nearer yet he observed that she was young and pretty; her face,
with its clear, yet delicate colouring, framed in curling brown
hair, standing out against the background of the old green
&ldquo;shed&rdquo; like a picture, as he said to himself.&nbsp;
The girl&rsquo;s eyes rested on him for a moment as she jogged
past, and he jerked his head at her sideways in a manner which
implied as plainly as words: &ldquo;Good day.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
nodded back at him brightly, yet modestly, and the vehicle, which
was, as Sol observed, filled with packages of various sizes, went
rattling on its downward way, the horse stumbling and sliding
every now and then, and being admonished in a high, clear
treble.</p>
<p>Dinner-time came, and rest, and then work again, and finally,
with a suddenness proper to the time of year, dusk.&nbsp; Sol was
just in the act of putting on his coat preparatory to leaving the
scene of his labours, when he caught sight, in the far distance,
of a wavering light, and presently heard the creaking and
rattling of an ancient vehicle which <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>he inwardly decided to be the
carrier&rsquo;s cart returning.</p>
<p>It was indeed the only cart of any kind which had passed his
way that day.&nbsp; As he picked up his bill-hook and walked
slowly to meet it, for his homeward path must perforce take him
past it, he could see the outline of the girl&rsquo;s figure, and
observe that it was bent forward; her voice at the same time was
uplifted as if in anxiety or distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, to be sure!&nbsp; Whatever must I do now?&nbsp;
Come up, Di&rsquo;mond, you&rsquo;re shammin&rsquo;.&nbsp; No, he
bain&rsquo;t, poor beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as Sol was a pace or two away she threw the reins on the
horse&rsquo;s back and leaped to the ground, the animal
immediately halting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be the matter here?&rdquo; enquired Sol, as she
lifted the lantern from its place and ran round to the other
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; He mid ha&rsquo; picked
up a stone or summat, or he mid only be lazy&mdash;you never can
tell wi&rsquo; he.&nbsp; Hold up, Diamond.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all
right; hold up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a stone,&rdquo; cried Sol eagerly,
&ldquo;and wedged so tight as anything.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis so big
as a happle&mdash;I wonder it didn&rsquo;t throw en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand!&rdquo; cried the girl, still in an exasperated
tone, as she deposited the lantern on the ground, and hunted
about for a larger stone wherewith to dislodge the pebble which
was indeed jammed in Diamond&rsquo;s hind hoof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me,&rdquo; said Sol.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep your
fingers out o&rsquo; the way else I&rsquo;ll be a-hammerin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; they.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>The rays
of the lantern, striking upwards, revealed a flashing smile which
belied the seeming gruffness of tone and words.</p>
<p>The girl straightened herself and stood
back:&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be long about it, that&rsquo;s
all!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m late as it
is&mdash;and tired just about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what be you a-doin&rsquo; travellin&rsquo; the
roads so late?&rdquo; enquired Sol, as he struck at the
recalcitrant pebble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do travel the road every day,&rdquo; returned
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do get my livin&rsquo; by it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
a tranter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sol was so much astonished by the announcement that he was
obliged to look up, whereupon Diamond immediately jerked away his
hoof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did hear of a maid bein&rsquo; a tranter
afore!&rdquo; remarked the hedger with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what &rsquo;ud ye say to a old &rsquo;ooman
of seventy-five bein&rsquo; a tranter then?&rdquo; returned she
triumphantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;My grammer have only just left off
a-drivin&rsquo; o&rsquo; this &rsquo;ere cart, an&rsquo; now I do
do it.&nbsp; E-es, we&rsquo;ve done all the trantin&rsquo; in our
place for nigh upon fifty year, I mid say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! well now,&rdquo; commented Sol, as he recaptured
the hoof, and resumed his labours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-es, my granfer begun it, an&rsquo; then when he died
my father kept it on, an&rsquo; when he died my grammer took it
up, an&rsquo; now I do do it.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t ye shift that
stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be coming,&rdquo; returned Sol.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis queer work for a maid, an&rsquo; lwonesome
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a bit lwonesome just about here,&rdquo; she
agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do generally have company part of the
time, but nobody comes our ways much, an&rsquo; this &rsquo;ere
bit o&rsquo; <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>lane an&rsquo; the track over the down is lwonesome, once
it do get so dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes!&rdquo; exclaimed Sol, as the stone,
yielding to an especially vigorous tap, dropped into the
road.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk a bit alongside of &rsquo;ee
in case the harse should go lame or anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no need to come so far out of your road,&rdquo;
returned she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not trouble you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sol, without heeding this protest, picked up the lantern, and
restored it to its place, and then extended a hand to assist the
girl to mount.&nbsp; She accepted his help, seated herself, and
gathered up the reins once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, and thank ye,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; part o&rsquo; the road wi&rsquo;
ye,&rdquo; said Sol, exactly as if he had made no such suggestion
before.</p>
<p>She chirruped to the horse and it plodded on, Sol&rsquo;s tall
figure keeping pace with it.&nbsp; Presently he rested one hand
upon the shaft, the lantern-light revealing how strong it was,
and brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Solomon Bowditch,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, an&rsquo; be it?&rdquo; she returned faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-es.&nbsp; What be yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sally Roberts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tranter Sally,&rdquo; remarked Sol with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call me that sometimes,&rdquo; she conceded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here we be at the top of the hill, Mr Bowditch.&nbsp; I be
goin&rsquo; to make en trot now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can trot too,&rdquo; said Sol, and indeed his long
legs carried him along at a pace that shamed the shambling
efforts of poor Diamond.</p>
<p>Sally protested, scolded, and finally laughed: Sol <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>took no notice
of any of these modes of procedure, his tall figure jogged along
at the same steady pace, just a little in front of the hood, so
that the light fell full on his honest good-humoured face, and
broad-shouldered frame.&nbsp; The cart went bumping and jolting
over the uneven down track, now threading its way between patches
of firs, now rounding a copse of stunted trees.&nbsp; At last a
few twinkling lights came in view, shining fitfully from a not
far distant hollow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our place,&rdquo; said Sally, pointing
with her whip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe now, then,&rdquo; returned Sol.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d hear ye if ye was to holler.&nbsp; Good
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that he turned, and disappeared into the dusk, before
she had time to thank him.</p>
<p>On the following day, at the same time, Tranter Sally jogged
past Hedger Sol, and Sol looked up with a friendly word, and
Sally smiled down rather shyly.&nbsp; When dusk came and the van
was jogging home again, a tall, dark figure suddenly loomed
beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be a-goin&rsquo; to keep ye company along the lwonely
bit,&rdquo; remarked Sol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis too much trouble, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
returned Sally, but she made no further protest.</p>
<p>The next day the same order of procedure held good, but on the
following morning no Sol appeared in the lane, for the hedge
which bordered it was shorn as close as a stubble-field.&nbsp;
Sally looked about her eagerly, but detecting no signs of life,
continued her journey with somewhat depressed spirits.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Nevertheless, in the evening, as the van slowly mounted
the hill, she heard the sound of hasty steps behind her, and was
presently overtaken by Sol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ye think I wasn&rsquo;t comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he
enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think anything about you,&rdquo;
returned Sally, mendaciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve come, an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more I be
a-goin&rsquo; to go on comin&rsquo; so long as it be so
dark.&nbsp; It bain&rsquo;t fit for a maid to go travellin&rsquo;
alone so late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can take care o&rsquo; myself, thank ye,&rdquo;
returned Sally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Sol with conviction, &ldquo;no
maid can do that.&nbsp; They was meant to be took care on,
an&rsquo; I be a-goin&rsquo; to take care o&rsquo;
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally tossed her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ve other folks to take care o&rsquo; me
if I choose to call &rsquo;em,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>Indeed it would not have been in girlish nature to submit to
the masterful manner in which Sol took possession of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be you a-keepin&rsquo; company wi&rsquo;
somebody?&rdquo; enquired Sol with some anxiety.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because there&rsquo;s no use my comin&rsquo; so far out
o&rsquo; my road if ye be.&nbsp; I be workin&rsquo; over
t&rsquo;other side o&rsquo; the farm now that this &rsquo;ere
job&rsquo;s finished, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve gone into a new
lodgin&rsquo;-there&rsquo;s no use my wastin&rsquo; my time, my
maid, if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want ye to waste no
time on my account!&rdquo; cried Sally.</p>
<p>Her voice was unsteady, and she blinked hard to keep back the
tears.&nbsp; No maid, she said <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>to herself, would like to be courted
after such a fashion.</p>
<p>Sol sighed impatiently.&nbsp; As a practical man he was
anxious to ascertain his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be there?&rdquo; he enquired, with a self-restraint
that was palpable and exasperating, &ldquo;Be there another chap
a-lookin&rsquo; arter ye, or bain&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact there was not, but Sally was not the girl
to admit it.&nbsp; She remained, therefore, obstinately mute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look &rsquo;ee here, my maid,&rdquo; resumed Sol,
after a full minute&rsquo;s pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must have a
answer to this &rsquo;ere question afore things get any
forrarder.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;ee till to-morrow to
think it over, and then it must be &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or
&lsquo;no.&rsquo;&nbsp; If ye&rsquo;ve got a young man of your
own then ye may cry &lsquo;hands off,&rsquo; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
let &rsquo;ee alone.&nbsp; If ye haven&rsquo;t&mdash;there
bain&rsquo;t no reason in life why you an&rsquo; me
shouldn&rsquo;t start keepin&rsquo; company reg&rsquo;lar.&nbsp;
So think it over, maidie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having now reached the top of the slope, Sally whipped up
Diamond, and the horse proceeded at its usual trot, Sol jogging
beside it according to his custom.&nbsp; When Sally&rsquo;s home
came in sight he disappeared into the darkness with a cheery good
night, leaving Sally disconcerted, angry, and sorely
perplexed.</p>
<p>She already liked Sol very much; she would probably like him
more when she had time and opportunity to study his character,
but to be pressed thus to come to a definite decision at so short
a notice&mdash;it was unfair&mdash;it was cruel!&nbsp; Above all
to be forced to own straight out that she had no other <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>lover&mdash;how could she bring herself to make such a
humiliating confession?</p>
<p>Very little did Sally sleep that night, and when she looked up
in the morning from her untasted breakfast and announced that she
had a headache, she was sufficiently pale to alarm her
grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can ever go joggin&rsquo; off in
that wold cart to-day,&rdquo; continued Sally, dismally.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you go, grammer, for once?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
a lovely day, look see, an&rsquo; there bain&rsquo;t so much
doin&rsquo; of a Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to be sure,&rdquo; grumbled the old woman,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis a pretty notion.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to become
o&rsquo; the wash if I&rsquo;m to go a-traipsin&rsquo; round the
country wi&rsquo; the cart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll manage the wash!&rdquo; cried Sally,
eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The steam &rsquo;ull do me good, I
think.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the neuralgy what be a-troublin&rsquo; of
I.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll finish the washin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; get on
wi&rsquo; the ironin&rsquo;, if ye&rsquo;ll let me,
grammer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Roberts assented, after much murmuring and a good deal of
sarcastic comment on the &ldquo;neshness&rdquo; of the rising
generation.&nbsp; There was never no talk of newralgy or oldralgy
neither when she was a maid, she said, an&rsquo; she was sure she
didn&rsquo;t know what the world was a-comin&rsquo; to.</p>
<p>Nevertheless she duly started off, encasing her spare figure
in Sally&rsquo;s warm jacket, and covering her head with an old
sailor hat which had once belonged to the girl.&nbsp; Sally,
indeed, had pressed these articles upon her grandmother with an
exuberance of affection which had somewhat mollified that <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>old lady, and
stood leaning against the door-post as Diamond and the van jogged
out of sight.&nbsp; Her face was pink enough to denote that the
&ldquo;newralgy&rdquo; was not in a very acute stage, and all at
once she burst into a fit of laughter, and clapped her hands.</p>
<p>It was darker even than usual when Mrs Roberts, much exhausted
after her round, set forth on her return journey.&nbsp; She drew
back as far as possible into the shelter of the
&ldquo;shed,&rdquo; and let the reins drop loosely over
Diamond&rsquo;s back as he crawled slowly up the stony lane so
often mentioned.&nbsp; Presently, to her great surprise, a figure
leaped out from the shelter of the bank, and accosted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you was never comin&rsquo;!&rdquo; cried a
man&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Grammer Roberts checked the exclamation which rose to her
lips, and flattened herself yet more against the side of the
hood, but she made no audible remark.&nbsp; To herself, however,
she observed: &ldquo;Ho! ho! Miss Sally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diamond continued his progress as though nothing unusual had
happened, and the newcomer paced beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use your holding your tongue, my
dear,&rdquo; he continued, after a pause, &ldquo;because
I&rsquo;m going to have an answer, one way or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A answer!&rdquo; commented Mrs Roberts to
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ve a-been makin&rsquo; the maid a
offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or
&lsquo;no,&rsquo;&rdquo; continued Sol firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If ye
don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll take that for a
answer.&nbsp; Now listen to I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Grammer
Roberts was not very quick of hearing, but she strained her ears
to the utmost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;ee till we get to the top of the
lane, an&rsquo; if by that time ye haven&rsquo;t spoke I&rsquo;ll
take it ye&rsquo;re willin&rsquo; to keep company wi&rsquo;
I.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s another chap about ye, ye must make up
your mind to say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There bain&rsquo;t no other chap as I know on,&rdquo;
reflected Mrs Roberts, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to know a bit
more about this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As though in obedience to her unspoken wish, Sol, after
another pause, proceeded to set forth his circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bain&rsquo;t much of a match for &rsquo;ee, I dare
say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grammer shifted uneasily on her seat: she was sorry to hear
that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mid go further an&rsquo; fare worse.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m earnin&rsquo; sixteen shillin&rsquo; a-week wi&rsquo;
the promise of a rise at Lady Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battered sailor hat nodded approvingly in the shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not got no dibs save&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; commented Grammer inwardly;
&ldquo;a few dibs &rsquo;ud ha come in handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact I tramped here from Bridport wi&rsquo; just the
clothes on my back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; said Mrs Roberts to
herself; &ldquo;there were never no tramps in our
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas my mother&rsquo;s long sickness what
cleared out all my savin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t deny the
poor wold body anythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mrs Roberts&rsquo; countenance assumed a benign <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>expression:
it spoke well for the young man that he should be so considerate
to the old and weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m young, I&rsquo;m strong,&rdquo; summed up Sol
energetically; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after you so kind as I can
if you&rsquo;re willin&rsquo; to keep company wi&rsquo; I,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll make ye a lovin&rsquo; husband when the time
comes for us to be married.&nbsp; Here we be at the top of the
lane now, and as ye haven&rsquo;t spoke, I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low
ye&rsquo;re willin&rsquo; to take me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Roberts jerked at the reins, but she was not quick enough
for Sol, who in a moment leaped into the cart, and took up his
position beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, my maid,&rdquo; he cried jubilantly,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re sweethearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that he flung his arm round her waist, and
endeavoured to plight his troth in the usual way.</p>
<p>But to his surprise, not to say stupefaction, a shrill cackle
of laughter fell upon his ears, and his advances were repelled by
a vigorous thrust of a hand that was certainly not
Sally&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, to be sure!&rdquo; cried a quavering voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did ever anybody hear the like?&nbsp; There now! well,
well!&nbsp; Dear heart alive!&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low you
don&rsquo;t know your own mind, young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still crowing with uncanny laughter, she stretched out her
wrinkled hand, detached the lantern from its hook, and held it up
to her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m dalled!&rdquo;
exclaimed Sol, utterly dumbfounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo; cackled grammer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall
I speak out now, or be it too late?&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low
&rsquo;tis too late an&rsquo; we be sweethearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;Here! wait! whoa!&rdquo; cried Sol,
distractedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, now,&rdquo; returned grammer, clutching him by the
arm, &ldquo;bide a bit, bide a bit.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be in sich
a hurry.&nbsp; P&rsquo;raps there&rsquo;s a little
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a mistake, an&rsquo; not such a very
little one,&rdquo; replied Sol, indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was a-lookin&rsquo; for another tranter, I
reckon,&rdquo; resumed grammer, archly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe you
was a-lookin&rsquo; for Tranter Sally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I was,&rdquo; admitted Sol, relaxing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my granddarter,&rdquo; remarked the old
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Sol, stiffening again.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
needn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; served me sich a trick then,&rdquo; he
added somewhat inconsequently.&nbsp; &ldquo;She needn&rsquo;t
ha&rsquo; made a fool o&rsquo; me!&nbsp; Any man mid be made a
fool on that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; agreed Mrs Roberts soothingly, &ldquo;you
was made a fool on, jist about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I&rsquo;ll get out now,&rdquo;
announced Sol for the second time, with sulky dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, bide a bit.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis lwonely here,
an&rsquo; ye know ye did promise to take care of I&mdash;he, he,
he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s struggle Sol, too, broke forth into
irrepressible laughter, and as the cart jolted over the downs the
mingled sounds of their mirth astonished the sleepy wild
things.</p>
<p>Mrs Roberts was the first to compose herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you be a-earnin&rsquo; sixteen shillin&rsquo; a
week!&rdquo; she remarked, sitting up and wiping her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sixteen shillin&rsquo; a week and the promise of a
rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a-got a nice little place down
yonder,&rdquo; <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>resumed grammer; &ldquo;a tidy bit o&rsquo; ground, too,
but it wants a man to see to&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do it?&rdquo; said Sol, in a non-committal way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It do!&nbsp; Ye haven&rsquo;t got no money saved, I
think ye said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Roberts,&rdquo; cried Sal desperately, &ldquo;will
ye tell me straight out, or will ye not?&nbsp; Be there another
chap a-hanging round Sally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d best ax her!&rdquo; chuckled the old
woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ax her same as ye did ax me, an&rsquo; tell
her if she means &lsquo;no&rsquo; she must say it.&nbsp; We be
just there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cart, indeed, now began to rattle down the path which led
to the hollow, and presently Mrs Roberts pulled up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bide there,&rdquo; she whispered in Sol&rsquo;s ear,
&ldquo;bide where ye be, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll send her out to
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I unhitch Di&rsquo;mond?&rdquo; enquired Sally,
appearing at the open door.</p>
<p>The firelight from within turned her fair hair to gold and
outlined her slight figure.&nbsp; Sol felt the last trace of
resentment melt as he looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-es, you can unhitch, my dear; an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s
a bit o&rsquo; rubbish in the cart what ye can have if ye
fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit o&rsquo; rubbish!&rdquo; ejaculated the girl,
pausing on the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-es, a bit o&rsquo; rubbish what was give me, but what
I haven&rsquo;t got no use for&mdash;so I make a present of en to
you, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that Grammer Roberts clambered down, and hurried into
the house, exploding with laughter as she went.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Though
she was discreet enough to leave the young couple to their own
devices, she could not wholly conquer her curiosity as to the
issue between them, and, pausing just behind the door, listened
eagerly.</p>
<p>A startled cry, a man&rsquo;s voice talking eagerly, a peal of
laughter&mdash;and then silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen shillin&rsquo; a week!&rdquo; meditated
grammer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope they won&rsquo;t forget to unhitch
the harse!&rdquo;</p>

17</span>&ldquo;LWONESOME LIZZIE&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late on a bright spring
afternoon when Mrs Caines betook herself to a certain
out-of-the-way wood, in the midst of which her mother&rsquo;s
cottage was situated.&nbsp; This wood lay at a considerable
distance from the high road, and the nearest approach to it was
across a number of ploughed fields, so that Phoebe Caines was hot
and somewhat exhausted when she at last reached the longed-for
friendly and familiar shade.&nbsp; There was a high wind that
March day, and Phoebe&rsquo;s face had been blistered alike by it
and the sun as she toiled along the road proper.&nbsp; Even in
the fields the light soil, newly harrowed, had been caught up now
and then by the mischievous wind and dashed into eyes and
hair.</p>
<p>But here was the wood at length, and the narrow little
moss-grown path along which she had so often tripped as a
child.&nbsp; Phoebe had been born and bred in that wood, as had
her mother before her.&nbsp; The queer little thatched cottage in
which the latter dwelt had been the old keeper&rsquo;s house, and
there Mrs Sweetapple had first seen the light.&nbsp; Her father
had been keeper in those far-away days, and both her husbands had
been keepers too.&nbsp; If she had been blest with a son he would
doubtless have followed the family traditions; but Phoebe was her
only child, and the grand new two-storied brick <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>house which
the Squire had built at a quarter of a mile&rsquo;s distance from
the old cottage was inhabited by a stranger.</p>
<p>The Squire had not had the heart to turn out old Lizzie
Sweetapple, who was allowed to live on in her tumble-down abode,
and to keep cocks and hens in the empty kennels, and even to
fancy herself extremely useful by bringing up a certain number of
pheasants.&nbsp; No hens were ever so conveniently broody as
Lizzie&rsquo;s, no pens so carefully sheltered, no young broods
so well watched or tenderly nurtured.</p>
<p>Mrs Sweetapple&mdash;&ldquo;Lwonesome Lizzie,&rdquo; as her
few acquaintances laughingly called her&mdash;was quite a
celebrated personage in the neighbourhood, and though her
apparently desolate plight won her much commiseration, she
herself never complained of her solitude.</p>
<p>But Daughter Phoebe did not approve of the existing state of
things, and frequently endeavoured to induce her mother to take
up her residence with her.&nbsp; The little pension allowed her
by the Squire would more than pay for her keep, and why not tend
children, of whom Mrs Caines possessed &ldquo;a plenty,&rdquo; as
well as cocks and pheasants?&nbsp; It was dangerous for her,
living so entirely alone at her age, where nobody could look
after her if she were taken ill; and if there were an accident,
such as setting the house on fire or breaking her leg, nobody
would be the wiser.</p>
<p>Though the old woman had hitherto stoutly refused to
contemplate any such possibility as illness or mischance, and
resolutely announced her <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>intention of remaining where she was,
Phoebe returned to the charge periodically, and the present
expedition was undertaken with the view of shaking her
mother&rsquo;s determination.</p>
<p>Being a practical person, she wasted no time in looking about
her now, but pressed on with as much speed as she could muster,
occasionally repeating over to herself the arguments by means of
which she hoped to convince the old woman.</p>
<p>Yet indeed the scene was lovely enough to have tempted a less
business-like person to dally on her way.&nbsp; The young grass
was springing up beneath the budding trees on one side, while on
the other the ground was strewn with fir-needles and last
year&rsquo;s beech-leaves.&nbsp; Grass and moss were alike
emerald green, withered leaves and needles copper and gold.&nbsp;
These tints were repeated again on the trunks of Scotch firs, on
the boughs of the heavily-clothed spruces; while the elders and a
few stray thorns had borrowed the living green of the herbage
below.&nbsp; The sycamores were brave with little crimson tufts,
and the larches most glorious of all at this hour, raising as
they did their delicate tracery of pendant twigs against the
luminous sky, imprisoning the light, as it were, in a golden
cage, the floating bars of which were studded here and there with
jewels&mdash;emeralds that would soon become tassels, rubies that
in course of time would turn into cones.&nbsp; The bank on the
right was studded with wild violets, and here and there primroses
grew in profusion, their tender young leaves flaming in the
evening glow almost like the blossoms they protected.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>At the
turn of the path Mrs Caines caught sight of the lichen-grown roof
of the cottage, and heaved a deep sigh of relief.&nbsp;
Increasing her pace she hurried on, unceremoniously bursting into
the kitchen, into which the door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis you, Phoebe, love!&rdquo; exclaimed old
Lizzie, coming forward to meet her, dusting her hands on her
apron as she advanced.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;m welcome,
I&rsquo;m sure, my dear.&nbsp; I scarce looked for &rsquo;ee to
come so late, though it be a goodish long while since I
see&rsquo;d ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children have a-had the whooping-cough,&rdquo;
responded Mrs Caines, dropping into a chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of all
the tedious illnesses that be the worst&mdash;what wi&rsquo;
coaxin&rsquo; of &rsquo;em to eat, an&rsquo; a-watchin&rsquo; of
&rsquo;em so as they shouldn&rsquo;t cough an&rsquo; a-make
theirselves sick the minute they <i>have</i> took their meals, it
do fair wear a body out.&nbsp; Little Isaac, the way he do cough
and the way he do choke, many a time I think he&rsquo;ll bust
hisself.&nbsp; He do turn the colour of a turkey-cock, he
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; said the grandmother
placidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You was never much trouble, Phoebe,
I&rsquo;ll say that for &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Every sickness what come
you did take so light as anything.&nbsp; An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s
some as ye did never have at all.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis wi&rsquo;
livin&rsquo; so much in the fresh air, I think.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
just mix this bit o&rsquo; meal an&rsquo; take it outside to the
little chicken, an&rsquo; you mid pop on kettle, my dear,
an&rsquo; rest yourself a bit.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have tea so soon
as I get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Caines unpinned her shawl, threw back her bonnet-strings,
and set the kettle on the fire.&nbsp; Then she heaved a sigh,
partly of exasperation, partly of fatigue, and looked about
her.&nbsp; The room seemed <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>just the same as ever, the furniture
a little older and a little shabbier than she remembered it of
yore.&nbsp; The grandfather&rsquo;s clock stood in one corner,
with the hands pointing to a quarter to twelve, as they had done
ever since she could remember; the warming-pan to the right of
the fireplace was not quite as bright as usual, perhaps, and the
china on the upper shelf of the dresser was distinctly dusty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor mother, she be gettin&rsquo; past her work, I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low,&rdquo; said Phoebe to herself; and the
reflection strengthened her resolution.</p>
<p>Continuing her survey, she presently gave a little start of
surprise.&nbsp; The old oak settle which ever since her childhood
had stood with its back against the wall, being but a clumsy
piece of furniture and never used, was now pushed forward in
comfortable proximity to the blaze.&nbsp; What fancy was
this?&nbsp; Surely her mother could not choose to sit on that
hard uncomfortable seat, instead of in the cosy elbow-chair in
which Phoebe herself was now reposing.&nbsp; The fellow to it
which had once been her father&rsquo;s, now, to her astonishment,
was relegated to the place usually occupied by the settle.</p>
<p>When Mrs Sweetapple returned, her daughter at once questioned
her on the subject, openly expressing disapproval, for to people
of her turn of mind any change in household arrangements, above
all any change carried out unauthorised, must necessarily be
condemned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name o&rsquo; goodness ha&rsquo; ye gone
shiftin&rsquo; thik wold settle for?&rdquo; she exclaimed, in an
aggrieved tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sich a great ar&rsquo;k&rsquo;ard
thing as it be, too heavy for your arms I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low&mdash;an&rsquo; <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>there&rsquo;s poor father&rsquo;s
chair set standin&rsquo; again&rsquo; the wall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Sweetapple blushed all over her wrinkled, kindly old face,
and answered confusedly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be jist a fancy o&rsquo; mine&mdash;jist a
notion!&nbsp; Some folks take some notions, an&rsquo; some takes
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but what be it <i>for</i>?&rdquo; persisted Mrs
Caines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;tis jist a fancy I tell &rsquo;ee&mdash;a
fancy o&rsquo; my own to make the time pass of an
evenin&rsquo;.&nbsp; There, I do make poor Bartlett an&rsquo;
your own father take turn about to keep I company, an&rsquo; this
be Bartlett&rsquo;s week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; gasped
Phoebe, staring harder than ever, and flushing in her turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there, I&rsquo;ve a-lived here all my life in
this same little place as ye know&mdash;all the time I were a
maid, an&rsquo; when I wed poor Bartlett&mdash;scarce a year
wi&rsquo; he, an&rsquo; nigh upon farty wi&rsquo; Sweetapple,
your father.&nbsp; By daylight I&rsquo;m bustlin&rsquo; about, ye
know, workin&rsquo; at one thing an&rsquo; workin&rsquo; at
another, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t seem to have no time for
thinkin&rsquo;, but at night, when bolt&rsquo;s drawed an&rsquo;
window shut, and I do sit here by myself, I do seem to see their
shapes an&rsquo; hear their voices.&nbsp; It did use to bother I,
thinkin&rsquo; of &rsquo;em both, ye know, an&rsquo; sometimes
one &rsquo;ud seem to be there, an&rsquo; sometimes the
other.&nbsp; An&rsquo; at last I hit upon the notion o&rsquo;
makin&rsquo; &rsquo;em take week about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, drawing imaginary patterns with her forefinger on
the polished seat of the old settle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, you&rsquo;re raving!&rdquo; exclaimed Phoebe
aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, no; I be in my senses right enough,
an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis wonderful how pleasant the time do pass when
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>I&rsquo;m
fancyin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m havin&rsquo; sich company.&nbsp; When I
do get the settle out, d&rsquo;ye see, I do call to mind the time
when Bartlett used to come here a-coortin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
Father&rsquo;d be out on his rounds most like, and mother&rsquo;d
be busy wi&rsquo; one thing an&rsquo; another, an&rsquo; him
an&rsquo; me&rsquo;d sit here side by side on thik wold
settle&mdash;there, I can call to mind as if &rsquo;twere
yesterday&mdash;the very things he used to say, an&rsquo; the way
he&rsquo;d put his arm round me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off, smiling to herself, her toothless mouth
unconsciously assuming something of the archness with which
doubtless she had responded of yore to Bartlett&rsquo;s amorous
speeches, her dim eyes looking past Phoebe&rsquo;s astonished
face, and past the smoke-stained wall beyond, to that far, far
away past, when she was a maid, and her young lover sate beside
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did use to talk a deal o&rsquo; nonsense
talk,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;It do all come back to me
now.&nbsp; I do seem to hear what he did say, an&rsquo; what I
did answer back, and sometimes I do find myself laughin&rsquo;
out loud, an&rsquo; puss&rsquo;ll get up from the hearth
an&rsquo; walk over to I quite astonished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to be sure!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs Caines, then
stopped short, astonishment depriving her for the moment of the
power of speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-es,&rdquo; continued Lizzie reflectively, &ldquo;he
wer terr&rsquo;ble fond o&rsquo; me&mdash;Bartlett were.&nbsp;
Even arter we was wed, he did use to say every evenin&rsquo; so
soon as he comed in from his round: &lsquo;Now then, little
&rsquo;ooman,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s have a
bit o&rsquo; coortin&rsquo; same&rsquo;s in wold
times.&rsquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d hurry up wi&rsquo; my
work an&rsquo; pop on a clean apron, an&rsquo; squat down aside
of en <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>on
the wold settle&mdash;an&rsquo; then he do begin a-talkin&rsquo;
nonsense talk jist so foolish as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew her withered hand pensively along the back of the
settle as she spoke, and presently continued in an altered
tone:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thik wold settle.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas here they did lay
en when they carried en in arter that there accident wi&rsquo;
his gun what killed en.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I knelt down as it mid be
here&rdquo; (pointing with her hand), &ldquo;an&rsquo; he
couldn&rsquo;t speak nor yet move, but he jist looked at I,
an&rsquo; I looked back, an&rsquo; I took his poor hand an&rsquo;
kissed it, an&rsquo; then when I looked again he wer&rsquo;
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure ye didn&rsquo;t ought to be
thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; sich things,&rdquo; burst out Phoebe,
with an irritation that was part real, part feigned, to conceal
her alarm.&nbsp; &ldquo;What call have &rsquo;ee now to be
fetchin&rsquo; &rsquo;em up arter all they years&mdash;fifty year
an&rsquo; more, I&rsquo;m sure, what have gone by since.&nbsp; If
ye must think o&rsquo; anybody why don&rsquo;t ye think o&rsquo;
poor father?&nbsp; The best husband as a woman need wish to be
tied-to, I&rsquo;m sure; him as was allus so kind an&rsquo;
worked for ye so faithful&mdash;why, you was his wife for farty
year very near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farty year and ten month,&rdquo; said Mrs
Sweet-apple.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do think of en, my dear,
frequent,&rdquo; she continued mildly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, as I
do tell &rsquo;ee, him an&rsquo; Bartlett takes it week
about.&nbsp; I do push back settle to the carner, d&rsquo;ye see,
where it did bide all the years him an&rsquo; me lived
together.&nbsp; I could never seem to have the heart to leave it
in its wold place here arter Bartlett died.&nbsp; So I do push it
back to the carner, an&rsquo; I do pull out Sweetapple&rsquo;s
chair, an&rsquo; I do set it where he did use to like it anigh
the fire, an&rsquo; I do sit in my own where you be
a-sittin&rsquo; now, an&rsquo; I <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>do fetch out a wold sock an&rsquo;
make a purtence o&rsquo; darnin&rsquo; it.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I do
look up now an&rsquo; again, an&rsquo; fancy to myself I do see
en a-sittin&rsquo; there in his shirt sleeves same as he did use
to do, an&rsquo; a-smokin&rsquo; of his pipe.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I
do say to en by times: &lsquo;Well, Sweetapple, an&rsquo; how be
the young birds a-lookin&rsquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful well,&rsquo; he d&rsquo; say, an&rsquo; then
us&rsquo;ll say nothin&rsquo; for a bit till by an&rsquo; by
I&rsquo;ll maybe tell en about a hen what I think &rsquo;ull soon
go broody, or a clutch o&rsquo; young pheasants what I do think
&rsquo;ull turn out very well.&nbsp; Why, there&rsquo;s times
when I do actually take en out o&rsquo; door to look at the
pens.&nbsp; I do light lantern an&rsquo; carry it, an&rsquo; I do
fancy I hear his steps aside o&rsquo; mine so
plain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; exclaimed Phoebe, &ldquo;do you truly
mean you do go out at nights wi&rsquo; the lantern an&rsquo;
all?&nbsp; Why, ye&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo; lost in the woods so
sure as anything, or maybe settin&rsquo; the whole place
afire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Sweetapple gazed at her, smiling again and rubbing her
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis only a bit o&rsquo; nonsense, bain&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; queried her daughter anxiously, struck by a sudden
thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do jist fancy you do go
out-o&rsquo;-door same as you do fancy you be talkin&rsquo;
wi&rsquo; my father&mdash;you don&rsquo;t truly do sich a thing,
do ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Sweetapple appeared to reflect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t rightly know, my dear,&rdquo; she
replied after a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s times when I
mid fancy it, and there&rsquo;s other times when I do truly think
I do go out to show father the pens.&nbsp; Last week
&rsquo;twas&mdash;&rsquo;twas father&rsquo;s week ye know&mdash;I
did get my shoes quite wet, an&rsquo; I did have a bit of a cold
for a day or two.&nbsp; I <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>think it must have come along
o&rsquo; takin&rsquo; father out to see the pens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Caines gazed resolutely at her mother, the colour once
more overspreading her already sufficiently rosy face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time there was an end o&rsquo; this,&rdquo;
she announced firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be tumblin&rsquo;
down the well some night, or else maybe go wanderin&rsquo; off
the Lard knows where.&nbsp; No, Mother, there&rsquo;s no use
talkin&rsquo;, the time&rsquo;s come for &rsquo;ee to
shift.&nbsp; Lady Day&rsquo;s very near, an&rsquo; &rsquo;twill
be so good a time as any other.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll speak to Squire
about it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll send a waggon to move as many
o&rsquo; your things as be worth takin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; you can
come an&rsquo; bide along o&rsquo; us.&nbsp; The children
&rsquo;ull be better company for &rsquo;ee nor they crazy notions
o&rsquo; yours, an&rsquo; if ye do want to do a bit o&rsquo;
mendin&rsquo; of a evenin&rsquo; ye can darn Caines&rsquo;
socks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, now, nay Phoebe, nay indeed,&rdquo; cried the old
woman in a shaking voice, her eyes becoming round with alarm, and
her lips quivering.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t shift, my dear,
I couldn&rsquo;t bide nowhere but in the wold place where I was
barn, an&rsquo; where I do look to die.&nbsp; The only
shiftin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;ull be then.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
shift to the New House, Phoebe, my dear, whenever it be the
Lard&rsquo;s will to take I, but not before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to Squire about it,&rdquo; persisted
Phoebe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Summat awful &rsquo;ull be happenin&rsquo;
if you do go on this way.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis time that he should
see to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee go for to speak to
Squire,&rdquo; pleaded Lizzie.&nbsp; &ldquo;What be the good
o&rsquo; carryin&rsquo; tales to Squire?&nbsp; I be so happy as
anything here.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want for nothin&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; I do never feel lwonesome.&nbsp; If you do go <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>puttin&rsquo;
notions in Squire&rsquo;s head&mdash;but you wouldn&rsquo;t be so
unkind, would ye, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoebe made no answer; the kettle boiled at this juncture, and
gave an excuse for rising and rescuing it from the fire.&nbsp;
She insisted on making tea for her mother, and, instead of
reverting to the vexed topic, chatted throughout the meal so
incessantly, and on such a variety of topics, that Lizzie became
a trifle bewildered; and, imagining from her daughter&rsquo;s
altered demeanour that the latter had come round to her views,
smiled pleasantly, and put in a word now and then whenever she
could catch the drift of the conversation.&nbsp; For, if truth be
told, her wits had become duller than of yore, and remarks and
smiles alike were a trifle vague.</p>
<p>Mrs Caines rose at last to take her departure, straightened
her bonnet, donned her shawl, and kissed her mother
affectionately.</p>
<p>Lizzie had already washed up and put away the tea-things, and
after returning her daughter&rsquo;s embrace, pulled down her
cuffs and shook out her apron with a pre-occupied air.&nbsp;
Almost before Phoebe had left the room she had installed herself
on the settle, and was gazing expectantly at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t go out to-night, whatever
happens,&rdquo; urged Phoebe.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good
soul!&nbsp; I can see ye&rsquo;ve got a bit of a cold
hangin&rsquo; about ye still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my dear,&rdquo; responded Lizzie, with a small
secret smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Bartlett&rsquo;s night, ye
know.&nbsp; I do never ha&rsquo; time to think o&rsquo; chicken
an&rsquo; sich when Bartlett be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoebe stared; then, taking her umbrella, left the
house.&nbsp; She heard Lizzie bolt the door behind her, <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>and walked
away, shaking her head and pursing up her lips.&nbsp; After
proceeding fifty yards or so she paused, and presently turning
retraced her steps as noiselessly as possible.&nbsp; The kitchen
window was already shuttered, but Phoebe knew there was a wide
chink beneath the hinge, and making her way towards it, peered
into the fire-lit room.</p>
<p>Old Lizzie was still seated on the settle, in the far corner,
so as to leave plenty of room for the other imaginary
occupant.&nbsp; She was smiling, and glancing now up, now down,
with that revived coyness of her youth.</p>
<p>Now she stretched out her trembling old hand with a curious
little gesture, as though stroking something&mdash;the crisp
brown locks perhaps which had been so long hidden away in the
grave; now she was laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did hear any chap carry on like that,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why we be old married folks now&mdash;six
month wed come Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoebe turned away from the window and stepped forth briskly
through the twilight.&nbsp; Her mind was irrevocably made up.</p>
<p>A wilful woman must have her way, we are told, and Mrs
Caines&rsquo; way appeared so very reasonable that even the
Squire fell in with it, though reluctantly.&nbsp; That he himself
should take active measures to turn old Lizzie out of her
cherished little house was certainly a most disagreeable
necessity; nevertheless he appeared to have no choice.&nbsp; The
old woman&rsquo;s actual plight was undeniably dangerous, and she
would no doubt be more cheerful as well as better looked after
amid her daughter&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Somehow
or other, Lizzie never quite realised how, it was made clear to
her that the Squire wanted her cottage for some important
purpose, and moreover wanted possession of it so soon that she
must turn out at once.&nbsp; Event succeeded event with such
rapidity that she found herself uprooted almost before she had
time to grasp the full extent of her misfortune, and was
installed by Mrs Caines&rsquo; hearth and surrounded by Mrs
Caines&rsquo; noisy little flock while still pleading and
protesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here you be, mother,&rdquo; announced Phoebe,
whisking off her parent&rsquo;s bonnet and shawl, and firmly
tying on her black net cap, &ldquo;here you be so right as
anything.&nbsp; Here be your own chair, d&rsquo;ye see, for ye to
sit in, and yonder&rsquo;s the dresser&mdash;how well it do look
in the carner, don&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll unpack the china
by and by, and wash it and set it out&mdash;that&rsquo;s summat
to do, bain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s chair opposite yours, same as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; murmured Lizzie vaguely, &ldquo;this be
Sweet-apple&rsquo;s week.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ees,
sure&mdash;&rsquo;ees, there be his chair.&nbsp; Where
be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes wandered round the unfamiliar room.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where be,&rdquo; she was beginning again, when Phoebe
adroitly interrupted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This be father&rsquo;s chair, as you do say, mother,
an&rsquo; this be his week to be sure.&nbsp; There you can talk
to en so comfortable as can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie glanced round again with a deep sigh.</p>
<p>John Caines, Phoebe&rsquo;s husband, worked in the Branston
brewery, and they lived in consequence in the town.&nbsp; Theirs
was a six-roomed semi-detached house with a dusty little yard in
the rear, and a tiny <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>grass-plot in front, on which Phoebe
sometimes spread out linen to dry.&nbsp; It was situated near the
station, and many vehicles passed that way, creating much dust,
and making a considerable amount of noise.</p>
<p>Phoebe presently commented on this fact to her bewildered
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis nice an&rsquo; cheerful to be so near the
road, bain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she remarked pleasantly, tilting up
as she spoke a corner of the muslin blind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye can
look out, look-see.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the &rsquo;bus from the
Crown, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s Sibley&rsquo;s cart, and look,
look&mdash;there&rsquo;s a motor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children all rushed to the window to investigate this
wonder, Isaac pausing midway to whoop violently.&nbsp; Lizzie
bent a vacant gaze upon the window, and then drew back into her
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis awful lwonesome here,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;terr&rsquo;ble lwonesome&mdash;there, that noise an&rsquo;
the dust an&rsquo; all; it do fair make my head go
round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoebe burst out laughing:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, to be sure, that&rsquo;s a queer notion!&nbsp;
How can ye be lwonesome wi&rsquo; so many folks about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie rocked herself backwards and forwards in her chair,
half moaning to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find nothin&rsquo; what I&rsquo;m used
to.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t seem to hear
nothin&rsquo;&mdash;wi&rsquo; so much talkin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
that there terr&rsquo;ble noise outside, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t
find&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off suddenly, sitting bolt upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where be the settle?&rdquo; she cried, in a loud,
anxious tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where be the wold settle?&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;ve never been an&rsquo; left that behind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoebe was taken aback for a moment: as a matter of fact, she
had purposely left it behind, not only <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>because it seemed to her worthless in
itself, but because she thought the sight of it would conjure up
those crazy notions which she was so anxious to dispel.&nbsp; It
was all very well that her mother should dwell on the memory of
Phoebe&rsquo;s own departed father; she might look at his chair
as much as she liked, and accomplish a bit of darning for the
family, under the impression it was for him; but it was quite a
different matter to go on in such a foolish way about a man who
had been in his grave for more than fifty years, and to whom she
had been wed but for a few months.&nbsp; The neighbours would
think Mrs Sweetapple daft indeed if she were to regale them with
such tales as she had recently related to her daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where be the settle?&rdquo; repeated Lizzie, with a
shrill cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, don&rsquo;t ye take on,&rdquo; said Phoebe
soothingly; &ldquo;there wasn&rsquo;t room for&rsquo;t in the
cart, d&rsquo;ye see, an&rsquo; us&rsquo;ll have to send to fetch
it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis so heavy&mdash;the poor harse couldn&rsquo;t
ha&rsquo; dragged it so far wi&rsquo; so many other
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be here by end of the week,&rdquo; said Mrs
Sweetapple.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must be here by Sunday.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;ll be Bartlett&rsquo;s week, come Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send for it&mdash;we&rsquo;ll send for
it,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs Caines.&nbsp; &ldquo;There now,
mother,&rdquo; returning to an argument which she had before
found efficacious, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ye go for to forget as this
be father&rsquo;s turn.&nbsp; Poor father&mdash;ye didn&rsquo;t
ought for to forget he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t forget en, my dear, I don&rsquo;t forget
en,&rdquo; said Lizzie, dropping her head upon her breast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do feel a bit confused&mdash;I bain&rsquo;t used to
childern, ye <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>see, and&mdash;I do feel terr&rsquo;ble lwonesome; I did
ought to be feedin&rsquo; chicken now,&rdquo; she added, half
rising, and then dropping back again.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
become o&rsquo; the chicken, Phoebe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t ye know?&rdquo; responded Phoebe,
cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr Foster&mdash;Keeper Foster, ye know,
he did take &rsquo;em all off your hands.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll see
to the little pheasants right enough, and he did pay money down
for the chicken.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got it safe for
&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; I did tell &rsquo;ee all about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ye did, so ye did,&rdquo; murmured Lizzie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was forgettin&rsquo;&mdash;it do seem strange to
ha&rsquo; no chicken to see to.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low
father &rsquo;ull miss &rsquo;em so well as me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Mrs Caines, staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low father&rsquo;ll miss
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; repeated Lizzie.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be
lookin&rsquo; to go out wi&rsquo; me last thing to see how they
be a-comin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear &rsquo;ooman,&rdquo; exclaimed Phoebe,
&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t go walkin&rsquo; out in the street
o&rsquo; nights here, fancy or no fancy.&nbsp; Ye mid be runned
over an&rsquo; killed straight-off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Runned over!&rdquo; exclaimed Lizzie.&nbsp; She looked
about her vaguely, and then sank into silence.</p>
<p>Mrs Caines drew her John into the privacy of the back kitchen
as soon as he appeared, and, with many shakes of the head,
explained to him the state of affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor mother be queerer nor ever to-night.&nbsp; Us
mustn&rsquo;t lose sight of her for a minute; there&rsquo;s no
knowin&rsquo; what she mid do.&nbsp; There, she&rsquo;ve been
carryin&rsquo; on about takin&rsquo; father out to see the pens
and about bein&rsquo; so lwonesome&mdash;lwonesome here in the <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>town, ye
know.&nbsp; She says the noise an&rsquo; the voices an&rsquo; all
do make her feel lwonesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Caines removed his pipe in order to grin at ease, and
then put it back again; he was a man of few words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; continued Phoebe,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;d best keep an eye to her while I&rsquo;m
gettin&rsquo; childern to bed, an&rsquo; then so soon as I do
come down I&rsquo;ll look after her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d best get
early to bed herself, poor wold body, she be fair wore
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caines removed his pipe again: &ldquo;But what must I do if
she should take a notion that I&rsquo;m the wold
gentleman&mdash;your father, I mean?&rdquo; he enquired in some
alarm.</p>
<p>Phoebe caught at the idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be
a bad thing at all,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low that &rsquo;ud keep her so quiet as anything.&nbsp;
Jist you go an&rsquo; sit down in father&rsquo;s chair an&rsquo;
if she do say anything ye mid jist nod back or say a word or
two&mdash;my father was never a man of much talk.&nbsp; I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low if anything &rsquo;ull pacify her that will,
but mind you don&rsquo;t let her take up wi&rsquo; any notion
o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; door.&nbsp; Here, wait a
minute, I&rsquo;ll come wi&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran upstairs, presently returning with two or three socks,
and preceding John to the kitchen, held her mother in play while
he seated himself in old Sweetapple&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, mother,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;here be some
socks what want mendin&rsquo; awful bad.&nbsp; See, I&rsquo;ll
light lamp an&rsquo; set it behind ye.&nbsp; They be
father&rsquo;s socks, ye know&mdash;Sweetapple&rsquo;s
socks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie&rsquo;s face lit up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, sure,&rdquo; she
replied, &ldquo;Sweet-apple&rsquo;s socks&mdash;this &rsquo;ere
be Sweetapple&rsquo;s week.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>She
endeavoured to look past Phoebe towards the chair, but her
daughter&rsquo;s portly figure blocked the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here be the needle, look-see, an&rsquo; here be the
mendin&rsquo;.&nbsp; The socks be terr&rsquo;ble broke at heel,
bain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning towards the light the old woman threaded the needle,
and Phoebe taking advantage of the opportunity thus created,
stepped towards her husband:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye offer to talk to her,&rdquo; she
whispered, &ldquo;without she speaks first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded in reply, and going towards the window she pulled
down the blind and jerked the curtains across.&nbsp; As she left
the room she paused to gaze at the two; John was leaning back in
his chair, placidly smoking, and Lizzie, who did not seem to
perceive his presence, was intent on her work.</p>
<p>Some minutes after her departure he bent forward and tapped
his pipe upon the hob, and his mother-in-law looked up, gazing
towards him through the semi-darkness with a pleasant smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve got your baccy pouch handy, Sweetapple,
haven&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>John nodded, and she dropped her eyes on her work again.</p>
<p>Presently a heavy waggon went lumbering past without, and
Lizzie looked up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wind blows hard,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think there&rsquo;s a starm coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; murmured John,
indistinctly.&nbsp; Lizzie picked up her sock once more, but
presently paused.</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if I covered the pens,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall us go out an&rsquo; cover the pens,
Sweetapple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John stared in alarm.&nbsp; What was he to do now?&nbsp;
Phoebe had not given him any instructions as to what he should
say if her mother suggested going out to see to the pens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They young pheasants,&rdquo; went on Lizzie, talking
rapidly to herself, &ldquo;they be terr&rsquo;ble nesh.&nbsp; If
a heavy starm of rain was to come on they mid all be dead in the
marnin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Where be the lantern?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose hurriedly, looking round her with a startled
air.&nbsp; John rose too, thoroughly frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missis!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;Phoebe! come down
this minute!&nbsp; Here be the old lady a-wantin&rsquo; to go
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoebe hurried down with all speed, finding her husband
planted with his back against the door for safety&rsquo;s sake,
while Lizzie, also standing, was staring at him piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweetapple!&rdquo; she gasped,
&ldquo;Richard&mdash;what be gone wi&rsquo; Richard?&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t think where I can be!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s this strange
place&mdash;and who&rsquo;s this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why &rsquo;tis John, mother.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ye know
John?&nbsp; You be here in our house.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve a-come
to bide along o&rsquo; we.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ye mind&mdash;Squire
settled it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squire?&rdquo; echoed Lizzie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ees, I mind
it now.&nbsp; I mind it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came back to her chair without another word, and said no
more until her daughter presently took her up to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as we&rsquo;ve done so very well to
toll mother here,&rdquo; remarked Phoebe, when she came down
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;She do seem to be frettin&rsquo; quite <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>sensible by
times, an&rsquo; at others she&rsquo;ll carry on wi&rsquo;
nonsense same as ye heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think &rsquo;tis such a very good notion,
to go playin&rsquo; games wi&rsquo; her,&rdquo; responded
John.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not do it no more.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t think what was comin&rsquo; next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie seemed comparatively tranquil on the morrow, however,
though she had slept but ill and was very low in spirits.&nbsp;
She looked at the children with the same bewildered air as on the
previous day, and started at the noises in the street, but she
made no complaint, except once when her daughter asked her to
repeat some phrase which she had murmured to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only said there don&rsquo;t seem to be no birds
here,&rdquo; said Mrs Sweetapple, half apologetically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It do feel lwonesome wi&rsquo;out no birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t look for birds in a town, do ye?&rdquo;
retorted Phoebe, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; agreed her mother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not used to towns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards evening she became restless again, and Mrs Caines
despatched her family to bed earlier than usual in order that she
might keep guard herself; her lord and master found it more
convenient to keep out of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s chair&rdquo; was duly set forth, and Mrs
Sweetapple sat and watched it, making an occasional remark;
whenever these disjointed phrases were of a dangerous tendency
Phoebe took care to recall her mother to the sense of her actual
situation.</p>
<p>No catastrophe occurred that evening therefore, and as the
days passed Mrs Sweetapple seemed <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>gradually to accustom herself to her
surroundings; towards the end of the week, indeed, she became as
silent during the evening hours as since her arrival at Branston
she had proved herself throughout the day.</p>
<p>When Sunday came, however, all was different.&nbsp; She went
to church in the morning, and behaved as well as even her
daughter could wish; she seemed pleased and interested, and as
much excited as a child.&nbsp; She had not been to church for
many years, and all was new to her.</p>
<p>The unwonted exertion tired her, and she was even more quiet
than usual all that afternoon, dozing in her chair for the most
part.&nbsp; Towards evening, however, she woke up with a
start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s gone wi&rsquo; the settle?&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherever be the settle?&nbsp; Bartlett
&rsquo;ull be here in a minute an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll not
ha&rsquo; nowheres to sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children began to giggle, and even John could not repress
a smile.&nbsp; Before the perplexed Phoebe had time to formulate
any soothing rejoinder, Lizzie started from her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fair dathered among ye,&rdquo; she cried
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where be the settle, I say?&nbsp; The settle
what my father did make wi&rsquo; his own hands and what poor
Bartlett did always sit on.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not be robbed
on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbed!&nbsp; Dear, to be sure, sich a notion!&nbsp;
Who&rsquo;d ever go for to steal such a thing.&nbsp; We did leave
it in the wood, don&rsquo;t ye mind?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
worth shiftin&rsquo;&mdash;there, I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; thought
ye&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; forgot about it by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I&rsquo;ve not forgot&mdash;an&rsquo; Bartlett,
he&rsquo;ve not <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>forgot, I&rsquo;ll go warrant.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be that
vexed when he do come.&nbsp; There, Phoebe, I never thought
you&rsquo;d go for to play I sich a trick.&nbsp; You did promise
I sure as anything, I should have it by the week-end, and here be
Sunday, an&rsquo; Bartlett &rsquo;ull be comin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;
he&rsquo;ll not find it ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ye shall have it to-morrow, we&rsquo;ll send for
it sartin sure to-morrow.&nbsp; Ha&rsquo; done, childern (in a
fierce aside to the youngsters), I&rsquo;ll not ha&rsquo; ye
makin&rsquo; a mock o&rsquo; your grammer.&nbsp; Stop that, or
I&rsquo;ll gie ye summat as &rsquo;ull make ye laugh wrong way
round.&nbsp; There, mother, ye&rsquo;d best come upstairs and get
to bed.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill make to-morrow come all the
sooner.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll see en fetch the settle by
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Bartlett &rsquo;ull be comin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
murmured poor Lizzie, who was shaken with the pitiful dry sobs of
the old.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll not
find I here, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll not find settle
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now, mother, nay now.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll not
come&mdash;he could never find his way to our place.&nbsp; These
houses warn&rsquo;t built in Bartlett&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Why so
like as not,&rdquo; she continued soothingly, struck by a sudden
inspiration, &ldquo;as like as not he&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo; for
ye down in the wood&mdash;at the wold place, ye know.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t ye think so, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees,&rdquo; said John, controlling his features,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis better nor likely he&rsquo;m waitin&rsquo;
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bidin&rsquo; there all alone,&rdquo; sighed
Lizzie.&nbsp; &ldquo;The house be empty now, and everything be
changed.&nbsp; But the settle&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, the settle&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; responded Mrs
Caines briskly.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll set on&rsquo;t
jest so comfortable as can be.&nbsp; Now you come along o&rsquo;
me, mother, an&rsquo; <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>get to bed.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
bother yourself no more about Bartlett&mdash;he&rsquo;s all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Sweetapple made no further objection, but went upstairs
quietly enough, suffering her daughter to undress her, and
getting into bed in obedience to her command.</p>
<p>When Alice, the eldest grandchild, who shared her room, came
up, she thought the old woman was asleep.&nbsp; But Lizzie was
not asleep.&nbsp; She lay there very wide-awake on the contrary,
forcing herself to keep quiet with difficulty, until the family
should have retired to rest.</p>
<p>At last the house was absolutely still: a duet of snores from
the neighbouring room announced that Mr and Mrs Caines were sunk
in slumber; but Lizzie lay motionless for an hour or so longer;
until, in fact, she had heard the church clock strike twelve, and
had noted the extinguishing of the street lamp opposite her
window.</p>
<p>Even then she lay still for a while longer, until the
lamplighter&rsquo;s steps had died away, and the little town
itself, which had ever seemed to her so noisy, was wrapped in
unbroken silence.</p>
<p>Then, stealing noiselessly from the bed, she began to put on
her clothes with as much haste as the necessity for caution would
admit of.&nbsp; The moonlight streamed in through the uncurtained
window, and she could find her way with ease about the little
room.&nbsp; The bandbox containing her bonnet was here, on top of
the chest of drawers, her cloak hung on one of the pegs beside
it; here were her boots, but she would not put them on until she
found herself safely in the street.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Out of
the room she crept, and down the narrow stairs; John and Phoebe
snoring unbrokenly on.&nbsp; Here was the door&mdash;the back
door&mdash;oh, what a noise the bolt made in shooting back!&nbsp;
She paused breathless, but no sound ensued, either of a hurried
foot upon the stair, or of an alarmed cry.&nbsp; With a gasp of
relief Lizzie crept out into the night.&nbsp; Sitting down upon
the doorstep she donned her boots, the clock striking one just as
the operation was completed.</p>
<p>One!&nbsp; How late it was!&nbsp; Would Bartlett be tired of
waiting?&nbsp; Would he have gone before she reached home?</p>
<p>Down the hill she went, as fast as she could, and then across
the market place.&nbsp; How quiet all the houses looked as they
stood thus with shuttered windows and roofs shining in the
moonlight.&nbsp; Now over the bridge and under the chestnut
trees, the cool breath from the river catching her heated face,
the delicious fragrance of the half-opened leaf buds filling her
nostrils.</p>
<p>Here was the turn now, and here the long, long hill.&nbsp;
Bartlett and she had trodden it once together when they had come
back from that famous outing to Shroton Fair.&nbsp; They had got
out of the waggon which had given them a friendly lift, just at
the bridge, and had walked home together in the moonlight.&nbsp;
She had hung on to Bartlett&rsquo;s arm, and he had talked
courting-talk all the way, just as when they were lovers.</p>
<p>The old woman smiled to herself as she tottered onwards.&nbsp;
It had been moonlight then and it was moonlight now, and she was
going to meet Bartlett.&nbsp; <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll wait, Bartlett
&rsquo;ull wait,&rdquo; she said to herself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not disapp&rsquo;int I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, dear to be sure, that was a very long hill, and Lizzie
was quite exhausted when she reached the top.&nbsp; She paused,
gasping, while she surveyed the prospect before her.&nbsp; There
were the woods before her on her right, the fir-trees sending out
spicy scents which might have refreshed her had she been less
anxious to get on; on her left the fields sloped away behind the
hedge.&nbsp; They were asleep, too, fields and hedge, like the
houses in the town; nobody was awake but Lizzie and poor
Bartlett, waiting yonder, in the empty house.</p>
<p>But that dreary white road, how long it was?&nbsp; First a dip
down and then a climb up&mdash;a long tedious climb, and the
corner round which she must turn so far away that it was out of
sight; and even when gained there was still more road, long and
straight and weary, before she could reach the short cut which
led across the fields to her own wood.&nbsp; While she considered
the greatness of the distance and the lateness of the hour Lizzie
became quite frightened, and wishing to make the most of the
downward incline, she set off at a kind of hobbling run.&nbsp;
Then, all of a sudden, she never quite knew how, something hit
her in the face; her whole frame jarred through and through;
stretching out her hand she groped about her blindly for she
could not see, and felt grass and a tuft of weeds: it must have
been the ground which had risen up to buffet her.&nbsp; But even
while turning over this new idea in her mind she lost
consciousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Mrs Sweetapple!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Lizzie
opened her eyes and smiled vaguely; somebody had raised her head
and was dusting her face with a cotton handkerchief: Lizzie sat
upright, feeling still dizzy, but happy and hopeful.&nbsp; She
had had dreams&mdash;curiously pleasant dreams&mdash;and was at
first astonished at not finding herself in her bed; but presently
remembered.&nbsp; Then a spasm of anguish crossed her face.&nbsp;
The moon was set, the gray light of dawn shone on her
companion&rsquo;s face and showed forth the ghostly world about
her.&nbsp; Would Bartlett still be there?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think whatever it was,&rdquo;
continued the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me an&rsquo; Jinny was
a-joggin&rsquo; along so quiet as anything, wi&rsquo; our load,
when I see&rsquo;d summat a-lyin&rsquo; aside o&rsquo; the
road.&nbsp; First I thought &rsquo;twas a bundle, then I
see&rsquo;d &rsquo;twas a &rsquo;ooman, an&rsquo; then I turned
ye over an&rsquo; says I: &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis Mrs
Sweetapple.&rsquo;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve a-had a bit of a tumble,
haven&rsquo;t ye?&nbsp; Ye did seem stunned-like when I did pick
ye up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie, looking at him vaguely, supposed she must have catched
her foot in something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever be you a-doin&rsquo; out-o&rsquo;-door at this
time o&rsquo; marnin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie collected her scattered thoughts, and resolved to make
the most of this unexpected opportunity.&nbsp; This was Jim
Frizzle, the corn-merchant&rsquo;s man, who had so often driven
past her house, with corn for the pheasantry and forage for the
keeper&rsquo;s pony, and who had even now and then halted at her
own door, to deposit a bundle or two of straw for her private
use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be you&mdash;be you goin&rsquo; up&mdash;along our
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees, I be a-takin&rsquo; a truss or two o&rsquo;
hay to Keeper <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>Foster&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; a sack o&rsquo; Injun
carn.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s lots o&rsquo; room in my cart; would ye
like a lift?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye kindly, Mr Frizzle, I would indeed.&nbsp; It
be a good thought; I be jist about tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;m afoot early.&nbsp; What brings ye out
at this time o&rsquo; marnin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tis nice an&rsquo; cool,&rdquo; she said
falteringly.&nbsp; She was learning to be cunning.&nbsp; People
looked so strange and spoke so sharp when she told her secrets
that she was now resolved to keep them to herself.&nbsp; If she
were to let on to Jim Frizzle about Bartlett he might, as like as
not, go and send Phoebe after her.</p>
<p>Jim let down the tail-board of the cart, and lifted her
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he said, as she sank
down between the trusses of hay.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be so
snug as anything there.&nbsp; You&rsquo;m a wonderful active body
for your years, I&rsquo;ll say that.&nbsp; I heerd ye&rsquo;d
shifted,&rdquo; he continued, after a pause, &ldquo;but I
s&rsquo;pose that bain&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie considered again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a-biding wi&rsquo; my darter for a
while,&rdquo; she returned presently, &ldquo;jist for a
while&mdash;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; back now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim jerked the reins, and lit his pipe, and they proceeded on
their way in silence, Lizzie dozing now and then, and waking with
a start.&nbsp; Their journey took a considerable time, for
Frizzle could not avail himself of the short cut across the field
and was obliged to proceed by road, approaching the wood at
length by a narrow green lane.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Lizzie
opened her eyes wide when they turned into this lane, and raised
herself a little, gazing eagerly towards the longed-for goal.</p>
<p>The sun was up now, and all the fresh and dewy April world
rejoicing.&nbsp; The grey-green fringes of the larches swung in
the breeze, busy birds fluttered from bough to bough, sending
forth ecstatic little notes; a rabbit scudded across the path
just as the cart entered the wood; Lizzie clapped her hands and
laughed.&nbsp; Jim turned round on his seat, and gazed at her in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be that for?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Lizzie, abashed;
&ldquo;&rsquo;twas seein&rsquo; the rabbit, I think.&nbsp; Did ye
notice the rabbit, how he did kick up his little feet and whisk
his little tail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most rabbits does that,&rdquo; commented Jim.</p>
<p>On they went, and now the cottage came in sight, the desolate
cottage with its smokeless chimney and shuttered windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it be all shut up,&rdquo; exclaimed Frizzle, as he
stopped before the closed door.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t nobody about, nor yet nothin&rsquo;
stirrin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gazed towards the empty kennels and the piled up heaps of
pens which the keeper had not yet found time to remove.&nbsp; But
Lizzie did not heed him; she had risen to her feet and was
endeavouring to descend from the cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, bide a bit, &rsquo;ooman, bide a bit.&nbsp; Ye
can&rsquo;t get down by yourself.&nbsp; Wait till I help
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He let down the tail-board and assisted her to alight, and
Lizzie, staggering towards the door, beat upon it with her open
palm.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>&ldquo;Oh, I must get in&mdash;I must get in,&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I forgot about door bein&rsquo; locked!&nbsp;
Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do!&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be
gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, that&rsquo;s a job that&rsquo;s easy
managed,&rdquo; responded Jim, and, applying his vigorous
shoulder to the door, he sent it swinging inwards on its
hinge.</p>
<p>Peering curiously in he saw a dismantled little room, dark,
save for the shafts of light which pierced their way through the
chinks of the shutters and down the chimney to the fireless
grate, and dismantled, save for a clumsy old oak settle which
stood near the hearth.&nbsp; But to his surprise Lizzie uttered a
cry of rapture, and tottered forward into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knowed I&rsquo;d find ye waitin&rsquo;!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d best look in again on my way
back,&rdquo; said Jim, as he clambered into his cart again after
depositing his load at the keeper&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
no notion the old body was so childish as that.&nbsp; I never
thought someway she&rsquo;d rid house
altogether&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ve shifted for good,&rdquo; interrupted
Keeper Foster.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her darter came and carried her off,
and none too soon either.&nbsp; There&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been some
mischance so sure as anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought it a bit queer to find her out on the
road so early.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d had a tumble too, mind ye, one
side of her face was all bruised.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t
till I heerd her call out, &lsquo;I knowed I&rsquo;d find ye
waitin&rsquo;,&rsquo; in the empty room, that I knowed for
certain she&rsquo;d gone silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take her home&mdash;along wi&rsquo; ye,&rdquo;
said the <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>keeper.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe to leave her,
and Mrs Caines &rsquo;ll be in an awful state.&nbsp; Here,
I&rsquo;ll come with ye, and we&rsquo;ll persuade her between
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got into the cart too, and they drove together to
Lizzie&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp; The door stood open as before, and
the room was very still.&nbsp; Lizzie was crouching in a corner
of the settle, with her hands outstretched, and a smile upon her
face.&nbsp; In the green wood without the boughs were waving, and
the birds were singing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lwonesome Lizzie&rdquo; was
lonesome no more: she had found Friend Death waiting for her in
the deserted house, in the guise of the husband of her youth.</p>
<h2><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>JESS
DOMENY ON STRIKE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hay in Farmer Old&rsquo;s
biggest field had been duly mown and tossed, and his whole staff
were now employed in carrying it.&nbsp; But the day was intensely
hot, with a brooding sultriness which seemed to betoken a coming
storm.&nbsp; Dust lay thick upon the hedges, and the ground was
iron hard; rain was badly needed, no doubt, but Farmer Old
devoutly hoped it would hold off just a little longer until the
crop was saved.&nbsp; He was a wonderfully energetic man, was
Farmer Old, and spared himself as little as those who worked
under him.&nbsp; All the long, glowing hours of that languorous
day he had toiled as manfully as any of his labourers; but now,
at length, he had left them to their own devices for a short
time, and the men breathed more freely in consequence.&nbsp; The
rattle of the hay-rake ceased as the driver, having reached the
corner of the field, paused to wipe his brow before turning the
horses.&nbsp; A little knot of men, deputed by the farmer to
ensure against any possible waste by following in its wake with
the humble wooden implements in vogue before its invention,
insensibly drew nearer together.&nbsp; One of their number
expressed the natural longing for a drop of beer, and another
incautiously provoked envious feelings by announcing that at
Farmer Inkpen&rsquo;s the men had as much beer allowed them as
they could drink at busy times.</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;He do send it out to &rsquo;em
reg&rsquo;lar,&rdquo; said Martin Fry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ees, my
brother James, what works for Farmer Inkpen, do say that they do
be carr&rsquo;in&rsquo; the jugs back&rsquo;ards and forrards
fro&rsquo; the house to the field so reg&rsquo;lar as if
&rsquo;twas but the family theirselves what was working.&nbsp;
There, it do make I dry wi&rsquo; naught but thinkin&rsquo; on
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jess Domeny looked up from the long roller of hay which he had
just raked together, and surveyed his comrade vengefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it mid well make ye feel dry, Martin!&rdquo;
he cried emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;It mid well make ye feel
dry.&nbsp; Sich a day as this be, an&rsquo; us a-workin&rsquo; so
many hours at a stretch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim Stuckey, perched aloft on the seat of the hay-rake, drew
the back of his hand across his lips, and remarked that it was
the drouthiest weather he&rsquo;d a-knowed since he was a lad,
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d see&rsquo;d a good few hot summers too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; resumed Martin, voicing the sentiments
of the party, &ldquo;our measter was so thoughtful for his
fellow-creeturs as Farmer Inkpen do be, accordin&rsquo; to my
brother James, but I truly believe a man&rsquo;s tongue mid drop
out of&rsquo;s head wi&rsquo; drith afore he&rsquo;d take a bit
o&rsquo; notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Measter b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t mich of a drinker
hisself,&rdquo; hazarded a lover of fair play, &ldquo;or else I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low he&rsquo;d have a bit more feelin&rsquo; for
sich as we together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did ought to ha&rsquo; feelin&rsquo;,&rdquo; cried
Jess, vehemently.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man same as Measter what be
makin&rsquo; sich a sight o&rsquo; money, takin&rsquo; prizes for
carn an&rsquo; layin&rsquo; by the dibs so fast he can scarce
count &rsquo;em, did ought <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>to have a bit o&rsquo; mercy on them
what do have to earn their bread by the sweat o&rsquo; their
brow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Measter do sweat too,&rdquo; put in an impartial
bystander mildly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He do sweat like anything,
Jess.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a-see&rsquo;d the big draps
a-standin&rsquo; on&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I d&rsquo; say is,&rdquo; continued Jess, after
pausing to glare at the last speaker, &ldquo;a man i&rsquo;
Measter&rsquo;s place what be set up over his feller-men by the
hand o&rsquo; Providence, did ought to act
providential-like.&nbsp; When the weather be that mortial hot a
man gets thirsty sittin&rsquo; in a chair, them what&rsquo;s set
over him did ought to see as he had a drap or two to
m&rsquo;isten his tongue wi&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a murmur of approval, and then the men prepared to
continue their labours.&nbsp; But Jess stayed them by an
admonitory gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye wasn&rsquo;t all sich a poor-spirited lot we
wouldn&rsquo;t be put upon the way we be now,&rdquo; he
remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way o&rsquo;
bringin&rsquo; measters to reason if men won&rsquo;t stick up for
theirselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick up for theirselves,&rdquo; echoed Jim, with a
startled look.</p>
<p>Jeffs transferred his wooden rake from his right hand to his
left, and, fumbling in the pocket of his corduroys, produced a
small greasy slab of newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ye chance to notice what the cab-drivers in London
done when they wanted their wages rose&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They went on strike&mdash;there, ye can read it for
yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin Fry stretched out his hand for the paper, and slowly
spelt out the paragraph designated by Jess&rsquo;s horny finger;
then he returned the grimy <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>sheet to its owner, with a shake of
the head and a pursed lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was readin&rsquo; a while back,&rdquo; continued
Jess, without heeding these signs of disapproval, &ldquo;how some
colliery chaps what was wantin&rsquo; shorter hours got their
way&mdash;they did go on strike too.&nbsp; The measters had to
give in.&nbsp; Well, why shouldn&rsquo;t us go on strike for a
drop o&rsquo; beer at haymakin&rsquo; time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others looked at each other and then at Jess, who, with
his battered chip hat pushed back upon his stubbly grizzled head,
returned their gaze defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d start it soon enough,&rdquo; he observed,
&ldquo;if I could get the rest o&rsquo; ye to back me up; but ye
haven&rsquo;t got no more spirit nor a pack o&rsquo;
mice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the farmer&rsquo;s stentorian voice hailed them
from the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, now then, what be doin&rsquo; over
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gate creaked violently on its hinges, and swung to with a
re-echoing bang behind the master, whose long legs carried him
towards the idlers at a prodigious pace, while, as he strode
along, he kept up a flow of sarcastic admonitions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low you folks do seem to think
&rsquo;tis safe to let the grass grow under your feet these
times, but I tell ye I do want to save this crop afore
thinkin&rsquo; about another. . . .&nbsp; Jim Stuckey, I hope ye
be restin&rsquo; yerself so well as the harses.&nbsp; Well, Jess,
ye be awaitin&rsquo; for the rain to fall, I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had reached the group by this time; Jim was already almost
out of earshot, the rattle of his machine drowning the last
words.&nbsp; But Jess heard them.&nbsp; His comrades had already
resumed their <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>labours, but he remained standing still, leaning upon
his rake, and surveying his master with a lowering gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry yourself, Jess,&rdquo; observed
Farmer Old, with a sneer.</p>
<p>He was a tall man, but spare of figure, with long wiry limbs,
and a face burnt mahogany-colour and fringed by a grey beard; his
small black eyes were as expressionless as sloes, but there were
certain humourous lines about his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; rain,&rdquo; observed Jess
sternly, &ldquo;a man mid very well wish for it these times; a
drap or two mid m&rsquo;isten his tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Old was so staggered by this remark, which, under the
actual conditions, appeared to him almost blasphemous, that he
found himself for the moment unable to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some folks,&rdquo; resumed Jess, &ldquo;as we was
a-sayin&rsquo; just now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak for yerself,&rdquo; growled Martin, uneasy under
the gaze of his master&rsquo;s sloe-black eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, an&rsquo; I will sp&rsquo;ake for myself,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll sp&rsquo;ake out,&rdquo; cried Jess with
spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say, Measter, a man wi&rsquo; a heart in
his body &rsquo;ud take a bit o&rsquo; thought for his men,
an&rsquo; &rsquo;ud not let &rsquo;em go wantin&rsquo; a drap
o&rsquo; beer on such a day as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A drap o&rsquo; beer!&rdquo; ejaculated Old with a
relieved laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what be the matter, be
it.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low, Jess, ye&rsquo;ve a-had a drap
too much a&rsquo;ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my oath I haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
exclaimed Jess, much incensed at this undeserved accusation;
indeed the mere suggestion appeared to intensify the longing
which he was supposed to have partially <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>gratified.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a-had a glass
to-day, Measter, nor likely to, seein&rsquo; it&rsquo;s Friday,
and my wold woman she do never allow I a penny at the back-end
o&rsquo; the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis because you do get through your
&rsquo;lowance at the beginning,&rdquo; returned the farmer,
preparing to move on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, now, bide a bit, sir&mdash;I&rsquo;m dalled if I
don&rsquo;t sp&rsquo;ake out as I said I would.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s Measter Inkpen, what haven&rsquo;t a-got so big a
farm as you&rsquo;ve a-got, an&rsquo; what b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t
a-layin&rsquo; by so mich money&mdash;well, when his men be
a-workin&rsquo; so hard as what we be a-doin&rsquo; to-day, he do
send &rsquo;em out some beer to the field.&nbsp; Martin Fry was
a-tellin&rsquo; us about it&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t ye,
Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Martin uneasily, &ldquo;I did hear
some sich talk fro&rsquo; my brother James what works up to
Inkpen&rsquo;s, and I mid ha&rsquo; mentioned it, but I
don&rsquo;t want no argyment about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to have no argyments,&rdquo; returned the
farmer blandly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Measter Inkpen have a-got his
notions, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve a-got mine.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll tell ye straight out, my bwoys, I&rsquo;ve got no
notion o&rsquo; sendin&rsquo; out beer to folks what be
a-earnin&rsquo; good wage an&rsquo; can buy for theirselves so
much as is good for &rsquo;em.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s better
wi&rsquo;out it to my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that be your notion, Measter, I&rsquo;m sorry for
ye,&rdquo; shouted Jess, whom the last remark had incensed beyond
bounds of caution.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, &rsquo;tis treatin&rsquo;
your human fellow-creeturs worse nor the beasts of the
field.&nbsp; Look at them cows yonder&mdash;ye&rsquo;d never
think o&rsquo; lettin&rsquo; them go dry.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t we
standin&rsquo; up to our knees in muck last spring
a-cleanin&rsquo; the pond for <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>&rsquo;em.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s one
a-standin&rsquo; in it now a-drinkin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;
a-coolin&rsquo; his legs.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low &rsquo;tis
enough to make a body envy the dumb brutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farmer Old fixed him with his expressionless gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jess,&rdquo; he returned, with a provoking
mildness which added fuel to Jess&rsquo;s wrath.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t a onreasonable man, I hope.&nbsp; I have no
objection at all to your goin&rsquo; an&rsquo; standin&rsquo; in
the pond to cool your legs and refresh yourself.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ees, I&rsquo;ll allow ye five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men&rsquo;s laughter rang out loudly at this sally; the
distant rattle of the hay-rake ceased for a moment as Stuckey
drew rein, and turned in his seat in the hope of ascertaining the
nature of the joke.&nbsp; But Jess threw his rake from him, and
turned upon his master with anger tempered by dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell ye what it is, sir,&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Flesh and blood can&rsquo;t bear it no
longer.&nbsp; I be a-goin&rsquo; on strike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Old surveyed him for a moment; then he glanced at
Jess&rsquo;s fellow-workers, just the fraction of a gleam being
perceptible in his inscrutable eyes.&nbsp; But Martin and his
companions raked away as if their lives depended on the speed
with which they accomplished their task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ye be goin&rsquo; on strike, be ye?&rdquo; he
observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to strike all by yourself
seemingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he glanced at the gang of rakers, whose efforts became
if possible more strenuous than before, and who appeared quite
unconscious of what was going on; then he set his legs a little
more wide apart and whistled.</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>&ldquo;Ye want a rise of wages, I suppose?&rdquo; he
continued calmly.</p>
<p>Jess considered, and then threw out his hand
impressively.&nbsp; There was a certain appearance of tension
about the bent backs of the workers.&nbsp; It would be a queer
thing if, after all, the master were going to give in to
Jess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Measter,&rdquo; said the latter with a virtuous
air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye rose me last year an&rsquo; I
b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t the man to ax for more now; but a drap
o&rsquo; beer&rsquo;s another thing.&nbsp; I be goin&rsquo; on
strike, Measter Old, till you agree for to send us out a drap
o&rsquo; refreshment at such times as these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad ye didn&rsquo;t ax for more wage,
Jess,&rdquo; returned Old, still mildly, &ldquo;because ye
wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; got it.&nbsp; As for sendin&rsquo; out
refreshment, as I did tell ye jist now, I&rsquo;ve got no notion
o&rsquo; doin&rsquo; no sich thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Measter,&rdquo; responded Jess, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry for to disapp&rsquo;int ye but I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; to
knock off work till ye give in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jist oblige me by handin&rsquo; me that there
rake,&rdquo; said the farmer.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a couple
o&rsquo; teeth gone&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to fine ye three-pence
for that.&nbsp; Ye shouldn&rsquo;t throw my property about that
way.&nbsp; I can pay ye the rest o&rsquo; your wage now if ye
like.&nbsp; To-morrow comes off, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; echoed Jess, staring a little blankly
however.&nbsp; He did not expect that Mr Old would accept his
resignation with so much promptness and such evident
placidity.</p>
<p>The farmer now produced a greasy leather purse and counted out
the sum of twelve shillings and nine pence.</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>He
doled out the last-named fraction in pennies, and as each chinked
upon his palm Jess&rsquo;s countenance fell more and more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but what I&rsquo;ve let ye have a
bit over,&rdquo; observed Mr Old, with a dubious look.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a bit ar&rsquo;kard to make a calculation all
in a minute like this.&nbsp; But there, you&rsquo;ve worked for
me nigh upon ten year now; I&rsquo;ll not be too close wi&rsquo;
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jess pocketed the coins and shambled away without
speaking.&nbsp; After twenty paces or so, however, he
turned.&nbsp; Nobody was looking after him; his late master was
now plying his own discarded rake; his former comrades were
working with the same fury of zeal which had seized them from the
instant of Mr Old&rsquo;s appearance.&nbsp; At the sight,
Jess&rsquo;s long-gathering fury broke forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how you treat I!&rdquo; he
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me, what&rsquo;s worked for &rsquo;ee ten
year.&nbsp; You do pack me off wi&rsquo;out a word.&nbsp; Ees,
n&rsquo;arn o&rsquo; &rsquo;ee has so much as a word to throw at
I, what&rsquo;s done my best an&rsquo; worked along o&rsquo; ye
these years and years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin Fry glanced up with a stricken look, but apparently
found nothing to say; somebody did murmur inarticulately that he
was sure he wished Jess well, an&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t say no
more nor that, but none of the others could be said to respond to
his appeal.&nbsp; Farmer Old gazed at him with apparent
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye be a-plaisin&rsquo; of yerself, b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t
ye?&rdquo; he enquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye be a-goin&rsquo; on
strike to plaise yerself?&rdquo;&nbsp; Jess rallied his
pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In course I be, but I be a-goin&rsquo; on strike along
o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; treated so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&ldquo;Well, ye&rsquo;ll not ha&rsquo; no more bad
treatment to complain on now,&rdquo; returned Old.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye be a-plaisin&rsquo; o&rsquo; yerself, as I do
say.&nbsp; I do like folks to plaise theirselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jess walked away.</p>
<p>Considering the strain of the recent struggle, the uncommon
heat of the day, the abnormal thirst from which he was suffering,
and the fact that he would shortly be called upon to face his
wold &rsquo;ooman, it is not surprising that he should have
turned into the &ldquo;Three Choughs&rdquo; before proceeding on
his homeward way.&nbsp; At the last-named hostelry he recovered
some portion of the valour which had possessed him in the field,
and which had been damped by the attitude of the farmer and his
men, and indeed felt himself to be a hero.&nbsp; Ten
minutes&rsquo; conversation with the missus, however, sufficed to
disabuse him of this idea, and he went to bed in a puzzled and
chastened frame of mind.&nbsp; Mrs Domeny had impounded the
remainder of his already curtailed wage.&nbsp; She had also asked
certain questions which Jess found it difficult to answer, such
as who did he suppose would give him work now? what would become
of her and the children? how were they to meet the rent if he
were to be long out of work? each query being coupled with the
persistent refrain, wasn&rsquo;t he ashamed of himself?</p>
<p>With the dawn, however, fresh courage came.&nbsp; He had done
what was only right in the interests of himself and of his
colleagues, and must surely triumph in the end.</p>
<p>The threatened thunderstorm had blown over, but nevertheless
it was a busy and critical time for <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>farmers.&nbsp; Mr Old would no doubt
be glad enough to come to terms now, that he, too, had had a
night to sleep on the matter.&nbsp; They would be cutting the
Twenty Acre to-day&mdash;the grass was almost over ripe and there
was Sunday coming&mdash;Mr Old might possibly invite Jess to come
back, and might even render the reconciliation more enduring by
making the required concession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a drap o&rsquo; beer to sich as he?&rdquo;
murmured Jess, as he hastily donned his garments; he himself knew
how much it meant to him.&nbsp; If Farmer Old did not come round
there would be no beer for Jess for a considerable time.</p>
<p>He arrived at the Twenty Acre a little before the usual time
of starting work, but found to his surprise that the two
mowing-machines had already begun operations.&nbsp; Farmer Old
himself was driving the one which usually fell to Jess&rsquo;s
share.&nbsp; Jess stood leaning across the gate with a pleasant
smile on his face until the last-named machine drew near him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marnin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; he remarked, hailing the
farmer in a genial tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do seem to be early at
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We be a bit shart-handed, ye see,&rdquo; responded Mr
Old, with a grin which displayed his remaining teeth.</p>
<p>This was the opportunity Jess had hoped for; he grinned back
expectantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It do seem a shame to see ye sittin&rsquo; up there,
Farmer.&nbsp; It must be a good few year since you drove a
mower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees,&rdquo; agreed Mr Old.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a
good few year now.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a nice change.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>He
flicked at the off horse&rsquo;s ear as he spoke, and the machine
went rattling up the field again.</p>
<p>Jess waited till it turned, and then marched round the gate
with a determined air, taking off his coat as he advanced, and
setting his hat firmly on his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; he cried, laying his hand on the
reins.&nbsp; &ldquo;This here job be altogether too much for
ye.&nbsp; You get down, an&rsquo; let me pop up in your
place.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t bide to see ye a-makin&rsquo; a slave
o&rsquo; yoursel&rsquo; same as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank &rsquo;ee, Jess, thank &rsquo;ee,&rdquo;
responded the farmer, clambering down with great alacrity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ees, I&rsquo;ll not deny I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; a bit
stiff for this here work.&nbsp; I reckon it &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo;
tried me a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forget as I did work for ye for ten
year,&rdquo; observed Jess, eyeing him sharply; he felt it would
be the proper thing now for the other to own he was in fault on
the previous day.&nbsp; But Mr Old appeared to have no such
intention.&nbsp; He handed over the reins with a beaming face,
and watched Jess take his vacated seat with evident
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do call it real handsome of ye to lend a hand same as
ye be a-doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Real handsome, but no
one do know better nor you that these be busy times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jess&rsquo;s countenance assumed a dubious, not to say
depressed, expression, as he set the mowing-machine in motion;
what did the master mean?&nbsp; Surely he could not think Jess
such a fool as to lend a hand out of mere neighbourliness?&nbsp;
His doubts increased when at dinner-time the farmer renewed his
<a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>expressions of gratitude; something very like a twinkle
appearing the while in his habitually expressionless eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not expect ye to come back this
afternoon,&rdquo; he observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll have lots
o&rsquo; little jobs to do at home.&nbsp; Nay now, a
favour&rsquo;s a favour, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d never be one for to
ax too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jess stared hard, scratching his jaw, and the other
resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a-heerd o&rsquo; folks going on strike
before, but I will say I did never hear of a man what acted so
goodnatured.&nbsp; There, most strikers do look on the masters as
they&rsquo;ve a-left, as regular enemies.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t many as &rsquo;ud offer to do a good turn on
a busy day same as you be a-doin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Your missus did
ought to allow ye a glass o&rsquo; beer to-day,&rdquo; continued
the farmer handsomely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure ye do deserve
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m dalled,&rdquo; growled Jess, under his
breath, however, for he had sufficient self-respect to accept the
situation.&nbsp; He walked away with as jaunty an air as he could
assume, and the farmer stood watching him for a moment or two,
shaking with silent laughter.</p>
<p>Jess passed a very dismal Sunday.&nbsp; His friends looked at
him askance, for his conduct had occasioned much talk, and he was
regarded in that little community in the light of a dangerous
firebrand.&nbsp; His missus lost no opportunity of impressing
upon him her views of his recent action; Farmer Old passed him
with a smile which he could not but think savoured of malicious
triumph, and Martin Fry, whom he chanced to encounter on his way
from <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>church, delivered it as his opinion that he had made a
sammy of himself.</p>
<p>The very indignation provoked by this remark, which, as he
thought, came ill from the man whose incautious speech had first
evoked in his hearers a sense of personal ill-usage, suggested to
Jess a new plan of action.&nbsp; Why not offer his services to Mr
Inkpen, who would know so well how to reward them?&nbsp; He could
not but feel gratified at the thought that it was in vaunting his
generosity, and in endeavouring to force Old to follow his
example, that Jess had lost his place.</p>
<p>He strolled round to Inkpen&rsquo;s premises at a convenient
hour of the evening, when he would be likely to find the master
disengaged.&nbsp; Fortune seemed to favour him: Mr Inkpen, very
much at ease in snowy Sabbath shirt sleeves, was leaning across
his gate, smoking a ruminative pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine evenin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; began Jess.</p>
<p>The farmer nodded a trifle sourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye haven&rsquo;t a-got all your hay in yet, I
see,&rdquo; proceeded Domeny.</p>
<p>Mr Inkpen removed his pipe from his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what business it be o&rsquo;
yours whether I&rsquo;ve a-got it in, or whether I
haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he returned, with what seemed to Jess
uncalled-for asperity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offence, sir, no offence,&rdquo; faltered the
latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do seem to meddle a deal too much in my
affairs,&rdquo; continued the farmer.&nbsp; &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t
matter to you, as I can see, whether I do give my men beer or
whether I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t got to drink
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; I only wish I had the
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>chance,&rdquo; said Jess with a sinking heart; it did
not seem a promising opening of negotiations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, why must ye go bringing up my name to Mr
Old, an&rsquo; a-tryin&rsquo; for to make trouble wi&rsquo; his
folks?&nbsp; Mr Old an&rsquo; me be good neighbours, an&rsquo;
don&rsquo;t wish to be nothin&rsquo; else.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
meddle wi&rsquo; his business, and he don&rsquo;t meddle
wi&rsquo; mine.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a pretty bit o&rsquo; impidence
for the likes o&rsquo; you to go a-puttin&rsquo; your word
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a mistake,&rdquo; stammered Jess.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Measter Old he did take I up a bit too shart.&nbsp; I did
but chance to mention to en how kind and good-natured you&rsquo;d
showed yourself.&nbsp; I did tell en he did ought to follow your
example and send out a drap o&rsquo; beer to the men at busy
times, same as you do do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been makin&rsquo; a fool o&rsquo; ye
wi&rsquo; such tales?&rdquo; shouted Inkpen, thumping the gate
with his fist.&nbsp; &ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low he was as big a
fool as yourself, whoever he mid be.&nbsp; I did gi&rsquo; the
men a drink once when they was workin&rsquo; arter time&mdash;but
as for makin&rsquo; a reg&rsquo;lar practice of it, I
b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t no more of a sammy nor my neighbours.&nbsp;
Well, I hear Old has gived ye marchin&rsquo; arders, an&rsquo; a
good job too.&nbsp; It do sarve ye right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plaise ye, sir, Measter Old didn&rsquo;t notice
me.&nbsp; I be on strike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inkpen glowered at him for a moment, and then burst out
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On strike, be ye?&nbsp; Well I hope ye&rsquo;ll like
it.&nbsp; All I can say is any master &rsquo;ud be well shut on
ye.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have such a mischievous chap as you
among my folk for a hundred pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you think, sir, I wish ye good <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>evening,&rdquo; said Domeny, endeavouring to summon up
some semblance of dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis what I think,&rdquo; retorted the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you be a fool&mdash;a mischievous
fool, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sorry for your wife an&rsquo;
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jess betook himself home again in a very low-spirited
condition indeed.&nbsp; Would all the masters think the
same&mdash;would everyone look on him as a mischievous fool, and
if so, what would become of the wold &rsquo;ooman and the
children?</p>
<p>His presentiments were but too well justified.&nbsp; Nobody
was anxious to employ a revolutionary who might at any moment
foster discontent and promote disorder among his peaceful
fellow-workers, or harass his employer with unreasonable
demands.</p>
<p>Two or three days passed by, and Jess began to feel seriously
uneasy; the long hours of enforced idleness wearied him and
weighed upon his spirits.&nbsp; It seemed so strange to feel that
there was no need to get up early, and no work waiting for him to
do: His missus, indeed, provided him with a good many odd jobs
which occupied him at first, but on one particular morning he
found himself absolutely at a loss.</p>
<p>Mrs Domeny was elbow-deep in suds; the children had all gone
to school; he had finished weeding the garden, and cleaning the
hen-house, and chopping the sticks; positively nothing remained
for him to do.&nbsp; There was no use proceeding towards the
&ldquo;Three Choughs,&rdquo; for his pockets were empty, and the
landlord had long ago refused to allow him credit.&nbsp; He
sauntered down the little flagged path and leaned over his own
paintless garden-gate.&nbsp; Old Bright, who was crippled with
rheumatism, was leaning over his, <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>a little lower down the row; Mrs
Stuckey&rsquo;s two youngest children were making dust pies near
their own gateway.&nbsp; Domeny&rsquo;s eyes wandered from one to
the other; no one was at home at this busiest time of the busy
day, except the women at their washtubs, the old folks, and the
babies; and here was he, Jess Domeny, standing idle.</p>
<p>The air was full of the scent of newly-cut hay, there was a
ceaseless rumble of distant waggons bumping in and out of the
fields; he could even hear the clanking of harness and the
distant voices of the men.&nbsp; Every hand was wanted on such a
day as this, but Jess&rsquo;s hands hung limply over the
gate.</p>
<p>By and by he passed through, and sauntered in an apparently
purposeless manner up to Old&rsquo;s farm, It was a comfortable
house, conspicuous at present for the bright yellow of its new
thatch and the glowing masses of crimson phlox now in full
flower.&nbsp; On his way thither he passed the field where
hay-making was still in full swing; Mr Old himself was plying a
rake.&nbsp; He looked up as Jess paused uncertainly on the other
side of the hedge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye be hard at it still, I see, sir,&rdquo; hazarded
Jess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, hard at it,&rdquo; responded the farmer,
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis to be &rsquo;oped as you wont upset
yourself,&rdquo; said Jess hesitatingly; he was anxious to
ingratiate himself, but had no desire to bestow a further mead of
service gratis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low it do do I good,&rdquo; returned
Old.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, a man do never know how much he can do
till he tries.&nbsp; I&rsquo;stead o&rsquo; findin&rsquo; myself
a man shart, I&rsquo;m reg&rsquo;lar vexed to think how long
I&rsquo;ve a-kept a man too many.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Jess
echoed his laugh in a half-hearted way, and then, finding Mr
Old&rsquo;s jocular humour a trifle trying, strolled on towards
the farmhouse proper.&nbsp; Here all was cheerful bustle.&nbsp;
Jenny Old was hanging out a basketful of linen on the
clothes-line which reached from the corner of the house to the
gnarled apple-tree; Polly, who was not so strong as her sister,
was sitting in the sunshine with a pile of garments in need of
mending; young Bill Hopkins was staggering across the yard
carrying a huge bucket of pig-wash.&nbsp; At the sight
Jess&rsquo;s interest quickened, and at the same time he was
conscious of a spasm of active jealousy.&nbsp; It had been his
office to attend to the pigs, and he had ever taken pride and
pleasure in every detail connected with his charges, from the
moment when they first ran squeaking about the yard till they
became bacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be the new litter come yet?&rdquo; he enquired in as
casual a tone as he could assume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, yes!&nbsp; Never see&rsquo;d a finer
lot&mdash;eleven they be wi&rsquo;out countin&rsquo; the littlest
what did die last night.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twarn&rsquo;t worth
rearing anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; reared it though,&rdquo; said
Jess.&nbsp; &ldquo;What be bringin&rsquo; the sow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he be gettin&rsquo; on nicely.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll do
all right on the usual stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did ought to have a meal drink,&rdquo; said Jess
firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haw, haw!&nbsp; You be terr&rsquo;ble free wi&rsquo;
your drinks!&rdquo; said Bill, slyly.</p>
<p>Polly Old tittered at the sally, and Jenny, catching the sound
of mirth, uplifted her shrill voice to enquire the cause.&nbsp;
Bill repeated the joke with a <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>guffaw so loud that it brought out
Mrs Old from the house, with soapy hands and an enquiring
face.&nbsp; She too laughed on hearing of Bill&rsquo;s jest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ye may all laugh,&rdquo; cried Jess
passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t no
laughin&rsquo; matter to I.&nbsp; Ye think ye may cheek me now,
Bill Hopkins, because I be down in the world, but I tell
&rsquo;ee, Mrs Old, if I did sp&rsquo;ake a word about the sow
&rsquo;tis because I&mdash;I&mdash;well there!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like to see the poor beast punished for want o&rsquo;
proper care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Old stopped laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye was always a careful man, an&rsquo; very
knowledgeable about pigs,&rdquo; she observed, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Jess, encouraged by these words of commendation, proceeded to
lay down certain rules of diet appropriate to lady pigs, and Mrs
Old listened in silence, nodding now and then.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of his harangue she ordered Bill sharply to
go back for the barley-meal, and desired her daughters to give
over gigglin&rsquo; and glenin&rsquo; and get on wi&rsquo; their
work; then, meditatively wiping her hands on her apron, she
strolled towards Domeny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a pity, Jess, ye don&rsquo;t have so much
sense for yourself as ye do have for the dumb beasts.&nbsp;
B&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t ye tired o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; on
strike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jess looked round him cautiously, and then back at her shrewd,
kindly face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mum,&rdquo; he said, with the faintest dawning of
a sheepish grin upon his face, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say but
what&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a-talkin&rsquo; for your missus,&rdquo;
continued Mrs Old.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>&ldquo;Oh, and have ye, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said Jess
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees,&rdquo; said Mrs Collins.&nbsp; &ldquo;I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low <i>she&rsquo;s</i> tired of it poor soul, if you
b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Jess, &ldquo;it do seem
as if I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; done better to ha&rsquo; left measter
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It do look like it,&rdquo; agreed Mrs Old, with
twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>She paused, polishing the top of the gate with a fore-finger
crinkled from its recent immersion in the suds.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Maybe if ye was to say summat o&rsquo; the kind to he, he
mid overlook it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Jess&rsquo;s pride struggled with his secret
longing; then the pride broke down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder would ye sp&rsquo;ake to en for me,
mum?&rdquo; he hinted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; Best say whatever ye do have to say
yourself,&rdquo; returned Mrs Old hastily.&nbsp; &ldquo;So like
as not he&rsquo;d tell me to mind my own business.&nbsp; He
b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t one as likes a &rsquo;ooman&rsquo;s
interference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; faltered Jess, after another interval of
inward struggle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll foller your advice,
mum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; cried Mrs Old, as he was turning away,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say for certain as he&rsquo;ll take ye
back.&nbsp; He was a-sayin&rsquo; t&rsquo;other day as he&rsquo;d
done the right thing to make a example of ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jess stared at her blankly and then went slowly back to the
field, more deeply depressed than he had yet been, since the
fatal day when he had asserted himself.&nbsp; Mrs Old&rsquo;s
words were ominous indeed: Jess had desired to be a leader among
his fellows, to be imitated and admired; not to be set up as it
were in a kind of moral pillory.&nbsp; He stood long <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>looking over
the hedge at the labours of the farmer and his men.&nbsp; At last
Mr Old, attracted by his gaze, came towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to take a hand again, Jess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, sir&mdash;leastways&mdash;I can&rsquo;t afford to
take a hand for nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t in
rayson.&nbsp; But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, quailing beneath the farmer&rsquo;s gaze, now
mildly enquiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The missus&mdash;my wold &rsquo;ooman, be
terr&rsquo;ble upset,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s
rent-day to think on, and&mdash;&rsquo;tis a bad job for I to be
out o&rsquo; work jist now, measter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a pity ye didn&rsquo;t think o&rsquo; that
afore,&rdquo; said Mr Old.&nbsp; &ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low
ye&rsquo;ll be a bit wiser in your next place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll have another place,
sir,&rdquo; said Jess, babyish tears springing to his eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, I can&rsquo;t get nobody to take I
on&mdash;&rsquo;tis a terr&rsquo;ble bad look-out for
I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis, &rsquo;tis indeed,&rdquo; agreed the other
heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I were thinkin&rsquo;, Measter Old, maybe ye&rsquo;d
overlook the past, an&rsquo; take I back.&nbsp; Ye wouldn&rsquo;t
ha&rsquo; no fault to find wi&rsquo; I again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
serve ye so faithful as ever I did, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d never say nothin&rsquo;, nor ax for
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped with a kind of gasp.&nbsp; Old turned his rake
upside down and thoughtfully investigated a splintered tooth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tis this way, ye see,&rdquo; he said,
after a moment&rsquo;s meditation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did say I were
a-goin&rsquo; to make an example o&rsquo; you.&nbsp; I did say it
to myself an&rsquo; I did say it to the men; an&rsquo; I
b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t a man what likes to go back on his
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Jess
looked at him piteously, his round ruddy face almost convulsed
with anxiety.&nbsp; Farmer Old, who was a good-natured man, could
not withstand its pathetic appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell ye what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he
cried; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s one way I mid take ye back
wi&rsquo;out breakin&rsquo; my word.&nbsp; I said I&rsquo;d make
an example of &rsquo;ee, an&rsquo; dalled if I don&rsquo;t do
it.&nbsp; There, I&rsquo;ll take ye back at same wage as before
if ye&rsquo;ll turn teetotal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Jess&rsquo;s expression had been pathetic before, it was
downright tragic now; he stood silent, with goggling eyes and a
dropping jaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye see,&rdquo; resumed the farmer confidentially,
&ldquo;&rsquo;twas the beer&mdash;or the wish for it what did
bring all this trouble upon ye.&nbsp; If ye pledge yourself to
drink no beer ye can&rsquo;t wish for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jess however was dubious on this point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be sich a disgrace,&rdquo; he stammered
presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgrace!&rdquo; repeated the farmer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the kind!&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll be an
example to the men, I tell &rsquo;ee&mdash;they&rsquo;ll be all
a-lookin&rsquo; up to &rsquo;ee, an&rsquo; a-praisin&rsquo;
&rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jess&rsquo;s countenance cleared in some slight measure; he
took the rake which his master proffered him, in silence, and
forthwith fell to work with great vigour and goodwill.</p>
<p>Jim Stuckey, jingling past with the hay-rake, halted beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be come to help again?&rdquo; he asked, with a
grin.&nbsp; Domeny looked back at him solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t on strike no more,&rdquo; he
observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a-come to my senses again,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve a-come back to work.&nbsp; I be come,&rdquo;
he added, straightening his back, and raising his voice for the
benefit of the others; <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>&ldquo;I be come to set ye all an
example.&nbsp; I be a-goin&rsquo;, Jim, for to give up drink
altogether.&nbsp; I be a-goin&rsquo; for to turn
teetotal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to be sure,&rdquo; cried Jim, much impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees,&rdquo; resumed Jess, after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
during which he had searched his memory for an appropriate text,
which he now produced in a somewhat jumbled condition.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have found out my sin an&rsquo; I be a-goin&rsquo; for
to forsake it.&nbsp; I be a-goin&rsquo; for to turn teetotal out
an&rsquo; out.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>No one was more rejoiced to hear of this doughty resolution
than Mrs Domeny; though from certain heated altercations which
sometimes took place on Saturday nights between the couple, it
might be inferred that in spite of his pledge the good fellow was
still troubled by certain rebellious hankerings.&nbsp; It was
even whispered that now and then&mdash;on market-days for
instance&mdash;Jess&rsquo;s gait was wont to become unsteady and
his speech a trifle thick, almost as of yore; but Farmer Old
never appeared to notice these lapses from the path of rectitude,
and Jess lost no measure of the respect with which he had
inspired his fellow-labourers since he had first proposed to set
them an example.</p>
<h2><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;JARGE&rsquo;S LITTLE &rsquo;OOMAN&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was eight o&rsquo;clock on a
summer&rsquo;s morning, and Farmer Ellery&rsquo;s haymakers had
duly assembled in his yard preparatory to setting forth for the
field.</p>
<p>The long spell of fine weather appeared likely to break up at
last, and if the hay in the forty-acre was to be carried that
day, every hand was needed.</p>
<p>The farmer, mounted on his stout black horse, kept a sharp
look-out as the folk came up, and those who were disposed to lag
and to gossip quickened their pace as they took note of his
expression.&nbsp; Several things had happened to put the master
out of temper.&nbsp; One of the horses had suddenly gone lame, a
wheel had come off the biggest waggon, and what was most
provoking of all, though every pair of hands was wanted, as has
been said, every pair of hands was not forthcoming.</p>
<p>Old John Robbins was down with his rheumatism again&mdash;and
where was George Crumpler?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s George Crumpler?&rdquo; Farmer Ellery
enquired aloud, taking a rapid and frowning survey of the groups
who had surrounded horses and waggons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be Jarge Crumpler here?&rdquo; echoed an officious
voice.</p>
<p>And then the answer came, first from one side and then the
other, <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>&ldquo;I han&rsquo;t seen nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; Jarge
this marnin&rsquo;;&rdquo; and &ldquo;He bain&rsquo;t here,
sir&mdash;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low he bain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer tightened his reins with an ominous look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been at his tricks again, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was yet speaking a figure turned in at the gate and
made its way quickly up to the &ldquo;maister&rdquo;; the figure
of a short, thick-set woman in a print dress and sunbonnet.&nbsp;
Drawing near, she uplifted a round, sunburnt face, and laid her
hand tremulously upon the farmer&rsquo;s rein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please ye, sir, I&rsquo;m sorry to say my &rsquo;usband
bain&rsquo;t so very well this marnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; retorted Ellery, with a
short, angry laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been taking something
that hasn&rsquo;t agreed with him, I suppose; it&rsquo;s happened
once or twice before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ve had a fall,&rdquo; the little woman
nervously stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fall, yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s not the first time
either.&nbsp; Cut his head open as usual, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bystanders looked at each other, and a smothered
&ldquo;Haw, haw!&rdquo; sounded here and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fell into a ditch once,&rdquo; resumed Mr Ellery,
with stern sarcasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was it a ditch this time, or did
he chance to knock himself against a wall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tripped over a log of wood,&rdquo; returned Mrs
Crumpler, diffidently; and the laughter of the bystanders began
afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you folks,&rdquo; shouted the farmer, raising
himself in his stirrups, &ldquo;what are you all idling about
for?&nbsp; Because one man&rsquo;s an idle, <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>good-for-nothing chap, are you <i>all</i> to lose your
time?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to make an example of George
Crumpler, and I&rsquo;ll make an example of everyone what thinks
he can play the fool and treat me this way.&nbsp; Stand out of my
way, Mrs Crumpler&mdash;you know very well, and George knows very
well, what he has to expect.&nbsp; I told him plain the last time
he went drinking that if ever I lost another day&rsquo;s work
through him I&rsquo;d send him packing.&nbsp; So he needn&rsquo;t
trouble himself to come here again.&nbsp; Let go of my
rein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs Crumpler clutched it fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please ye, sir,&rdquo; she said firmly,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no occasion for ye to be at the loss of a
day&rsquo;s work along o&rsquo; Crumpler bein&rsquo;
laid-up&mdash;I be come to take his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried Ellery, &ldquo;you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-es, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs Crumpler with a kind of
modest assurance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can work just so well as
he.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; what he do do as I
can&rsquo;t do if ye&rsquo;ll let me try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can ye drive a hayrake, then?&rdquo; cried the farmer,
with a laugh that was half-fierce and half-amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a hayrake, no, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the little
woman after a moment&rsquo;s reflection; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
like for to undertake a hayrake&mdash;but a cart or a
waggon&mdash;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I could drive either o&rsquo;
them just so well as anybody.&nbsp; And I could use a hand-rake,
or I could toss up hay wi&rsquo; a pitchfork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve got such fine long arms,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; rejoined Ellery, eyeing her diminutive
proportions.</p>
<p>But Mrs Crumpler was not discouraged: &ldquo;They <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>mid be shart,
sir, but they be terr&rsquo;ble strong,&rdquo; she returned;
&ldquo;feel o&rsquo; them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer laughed again, but this time more
good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you was to give me a trial, sir, I think you&rsquo;d
be satisfied,&rdquo; pleaded Mrs Crumpler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can try as much as you like,&rdquo; returned
the master, twitching the rein from her hand, and eyeing her with
a smile that was not unkindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
you&rsquo;ll make much hand of it, but you&rsquo;re welcome to
try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank &rsquo;ee, sir,&rdquo; she responded,
fervently.&nbsp; &ldquo;What be I to do then, please,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ll try what your arms are made of, since
you&rsquo;re so proud of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find a
pitchfork in that shed yonder.&nbsp; Be sprack and get it, and
follow the rest o&rsquo; the folks up along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He chuckled as he watched her cross the yard and dive into the
shed, reappearing in a twinkling with a pitchfork as tall as
herself.&nbsp; Having seen her shoulder this and hasten away with
it, he put his horse to a trot, and presently forgot all about
Mrs Crumpler in attending to more weighty matters.</p>
<p>The little woman&rsquo;s appearance in the field was greeted
with a shout of laughter; but, nothing daunted, she made her way
to the nearest waggon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be come to lend a hand,&rdquo; she declared; &ldquo;I
be come to take Jarge&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The announcement was treated as a good joke; old Joe Weatherby
grinned down at her from the waggon, while Bill Frost paused with
an immense bundle of hay poised on his fork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It bain&rsquo;t much of a hand what you&rsquo;ll be
lendin&rsquo;, <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>Sally; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low your arms won&rsquo;t reach
much further nor a child&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon see that,&rdquo; returned Sally
valiantly; then, smiling up at Joe, she continued, &ldquo;I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low a woman bain&rsquo;t fit for much if she
can&rsquo;t take her husband&rsquo;s place now an&rsquo; again
when he be laid by the heels.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s that to start
wi&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drove the prongs of her fork into the nearest haycock, and
adroitly tossed a goodly truss to Joe, who proceeded to spread
and trample it after the recognised fashion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
then, here&rsquo;s another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally&rsquo;s fork went backwards and forwards with so much
speed and energy that Joe presently pleaded for mercy, announcing
that she was ready for him before he could get ready for she.</p>
<p>But Bill laughed sardonically.&nbsp; &ldquo;It be all very
well now the wain be near empty.&nbsp; Bide a bit till the load
do begin to grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the hay mounted higher and higher, indeed, in response to
the combined efforts of himself and Mrs Crumpler, the poor little
creature found the work more difficult to accomplish.&nbsp; She
made strenuous efforts, holding her pitchfork at its extreme end,
tossing the hay with all her strength, even jumping occasionally;
but over and over again the truss tumbled down from her fork
before she could cast it into its allotted place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low ye&rsquo;ll have to give
in,&rdquo; said Joe, gazing down at her from his eminence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;on&rsquo;t then!&rdquo; said Sally; and then
she burst into tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she
explained between her sobs.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t do
Jarge&rsquo;s work the maister &rsquo;ull turn en off.&nbsp; He
said so.&nbsp; Here, I&rsquo;ll try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>&ldquo;Nay now, nay now,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;ye mid
have the best &rsquo;eart in the world yet yer arms
midden&rsquo;t be no longer.&nbsp; Tell &rsquo;ee what&mdash;ye
can be rakin&rsquo; the stuff together, while me and Bill do
finish this lot, an&rsquo; when we do bring the waggon back ye
can take my place on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally dropped the apron with which she had been wiping her
eyes, and thanked him gratefully; then, exchanging her fork for a
wooden rake, she turned energetically to her new task.</p>
<p>By-and-by the waggon went creaking out of the field, and
presently returned empty, whereupon Mrs Crumpler proudly
clambered up on it.&nbsp; Her goodwill and energy were certainly
unfailing; nevertheless, she presently discovered that something
more was required for the successful loading of a waggon.&nbsp;
It was very difficult to spread the hay evenly, and, trample as
she might, she could not get it to lie as firmly as when Joe was
in possession.</p>
<p>When Farmer Ellery rode round, he paused for quite a long
while watching her operations, and though Sally worked feverishly
hard, and feigned to take no notice of him, her heart beat so
fast that she could scarcely breathe, and when he presently
called her by name, she gave such a start that she dropped her
pitchfork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this job is altogether in your
line, Mrs Crumpler,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
<p>Sally timidly raised her eyes to his face, but could make
nothing of it, half-hidden as it was by his great brown
beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bain&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; on so very bad, thank
&rsquo;ee, sir,&rdquo; she answered, curtseying as well as she
could on top of <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>her load.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be
able to manage better with a little more practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and while you&rsquo;re practising my hay will be
sliding about all over the field,&rdquo; he rejoined
gruffly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d best get down again and give up
your place to Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Crumpler meekly slid to the ground, and came up to the
farmer, remarking with an ingratiating smile which belied her
anxious eyes, &ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I&rsquo;m best at
rakin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low you are.&nbsp; But you undertook
to fill George&rsquo;s place.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t pay George for
doing boy&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Crumpler cogitated with a troubled face for a moment, and
then her brow cleared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could come two days for Jarge&rsquo;s one,&rdquo; she
cried triumphantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis to be hoped
he&rsquo;ll be all right to-morrow and able to do his work, but
I&rsquo;ll come up this way, sir, if ye&rsquo;ll let
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a plucky little soul, I&rsquo;ll say
that for you,&rdquo; remarked the farmer, more good-naturedly
than he had yet spoken.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, get your rake
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Ellery&rsquo;s words of eulogy were repeated by many voices
when the men assembled at the dinner hour in the shady corner
near the pool.&nbsp; Mrs Crumpler elected to go home for that
meal, remarking cheerfully that she thought Jarge would be pretty
well hisself by that time, and would be lookin&rsquo; out for a
bite o&rsquo; summat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maister hissel&rsquo; did tell her she was a good
plucked &rsquo;un,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;and so she be.&nbsp;
I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low there bain&rsquo;t many &rsquo;oomen as
&rsquo;ud gie theirselves all that trouble for a chap like
Jarge.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>&ldquo;I could wish my missus &rsquo;ud take a leaf out
of her book.&nbsp; There, the way the &rsquo;ooman do go on if I
do take so much as the leastest drap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wold &rsquo;ooman wouldn&rsquo;t put herself out for
I, neither,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>As they sat and watched the retreating figure of Mrs Crumpler
hastening across the field, they felt themselves more and more
injured, and were disposed to vent their grievances on their own
women-kind, who presently appeared to minister to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few spuds,&rdquo; remarked Bill, discontentedly
prodding at the little basin from which his wife had just removed
the cloth.&nbsp; &ldquo;A few spuds and hardly so much grease to
&rsquo;em as &rsquo;ll m&rsquo;isten &rsquo;em.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
a-had a little &rsquo;ooman among us to-day as could show
&rsquo;ee summat, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A &rsquo;ooman!&rdquo; cried Mrs Frost, instantly on
the alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, e-es,&rdquo; responded Bill, shaking his
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;A &rsquo;ooman as knowed summat of the duties
of a wife, didn&rsquo;t she, Ed&rsquo;ard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jist about,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Ed&rsquo;ard&rdquo; with
his mouth full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A &rsquo;ooman what come down to take her
husband&rsquo;s place along o&rsquo; his bein&rsquo; a bit drinky
to-day an&rsquo; not able to work.&nbsp; She did come to the
maister so bold as a lion, an&rsquo; she did say, &lsquo;Here be
I, so well able to do a day&rsquo;s work as
he&rsquo;&mdash;didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; put in Joe, raising his head from a mug of
cider which had just found its way into his hands,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; when she did find she couldn&rsquo;t get on so
fast as us menfolks, she says to maister, &lsquo;I can do two
days&rsquo; work then,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;to make up for
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a &rsquo;ooman!&rdquo;&nbsp; With a
further shake of the head as a tribute to the absent Mrs
Crumpler, Joe applied <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>himself to the cider-mug again, but
this last remark was taken up by several of his neighbours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a &rsquo;ooman, indeed,&rdquo; they said,
and every man whose better-half chanced to be in attendance
looked reproachfully at her as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; exclaimed one irate
matron, catching up her empty basket, &ldquo;she must be a
wonderful faymale whoever she mid be, but I&rsquo;d like to know
who looks after the house while she be traipsin&rsquo; about
i&rsquo; the fields.&nbsp; Some folks has one notion o&rsquo;
dooty an&rsquo; some has another.&nbsp; To my mind it&rsquo;s
more a &rsquo;ooman&rsquo;s duty to see to things at
home&mdash;to get her husband&rsquo;s dinner an&rsquo;
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, &rsquo;tis just the very thing what she&rsquo;ve
gone home-along to do,&rdquo; shouted Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; so tired as the creature was, too,
wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said somebody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that was she,&rdquo; rejoined somebody else.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There she was fair wore out.&nbsp; The perspiration was
a-pourin&rsquo; down her face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sit down an&rsquo;
rest, do, my dear,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; says
she, &lsquo;I must run home so quick as I can to get my
Jarge&rsquo;s dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jarge!&rdquo; said Mrs Frost, with withering scorn,
&ldquo;Jarge!&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be that poor little down-trod Mrs
Crumpler they be all keepin&rsquo; up such a charm about,&rdquo;
she explained contemptuously to her neighbour with the
basket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs Crumpler&mdash;that poor little
plain-faytured&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Handsome is as handsome does,&rdquo; interrupted Bill;
&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low Jarge do think Sally hasn&rsquo;t
her match i&rsquo; th&rsquo; world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You be a plucky little
&rsquo;ooman,&rsquo;&rdquo; chanted old Joe, gazing maliciously
at the crestfallen assemblage of <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>matrons; &ldquo;them was Farmer
Ellery&rsquo;s words: a plucky little &rsquo;ooman.&nbsp; Be
there any cider left&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand it here, then,&rdquo; cried Joe with a virtuous
air; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll drink Mrs Crumpler&rsquo;s
health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs Frost, turning away with an
indignant air, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like to have Mrs
Crumpler&rsquo;s conscience, however plucky she mid be.&nbsp; A
body would have thought &rsquo;twas bad enough to have a drunken
husband wi&rsquo;out teachin&rsquo; other folks to get into bad
ways.&nbsp; Drink her health, indeed!&nbsp; Somebody did ought to
speak to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion was warmly taken up, and a select deputation of
three immediately turned their steps in the direction of Mrs
Crumpler&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p>The matron with the basket, one Mrs Dewey by name, had
volunteered to be spokeswoman; but she stopped short in the open
doorway conscious of a certain diffidence, for Mr Crumpler, very
pale in complexion and watery about the eyes, was up and seated
in his elbow-chair by the fire.</p>
<p>Sally, who with a flushed and tired face was making hasty
preparations for dinner, turned as Mrs Dewey paused on the
threshold, and smiled cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, do, Mrs Dewey, I haven&rsquo;t a minute to
shake hands&mdash;I be terr&rsquo;ble busy.&nbsp; There, my poor
husband did have a accident last night, an&rsquo; I be
takin&rsquo; his place in the hay-field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we heared,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs Dewey sedately.</p>
<p>She stepped in, followed by Mrs Frost and Jenny Weatherby, the
remaining member of the deputation, a spinster with a father just
as troublesome as <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>anybody else&rsquo;s husband.&nbsp; All took their seats
in response to a hurried wave of Mrs Crumpler&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ye&rsquo;ve heared!&rdquo; said Sally, looking from
one to the other with a somewhat awkward laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-es,&rdquo; said Mrs Dewey, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
heared.&nbsp; An&rsquo; we did hear the cause o&rsquo; your
doin&rsquo; it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, an&rsquo; did you?&rdquo; said Sally.</p>
<p>Mr Crumpler cleared his throat in an absent-minded kind of
way, and looked abstractedly at the fire.</p>
<p>Mrs Frost, after waiting a second or two to see if Mrs Dewey
would take the initiative, shot a severe glance in his direction,
and then addressed herself to his wife, who, with symptoms of
gathering irritation, not unmixed with perturbation, was now
laying the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-es, Mrs Crumpler,&rdquo; she said, in a loud, clear
voice, &ldquo;me and Mrs Dewey an&rsquo; Jenny Weatherby there,
us felt it our dooty to step up an&rsquo; say a word or two to ye
about it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis terr&rsquo;ble bad example what
you&rsquo;ve a-been a-givin&rsquo; to-day, Mrs
Crumpler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad example!&rdquo; gasped Sally, clapping down the
tumbler which she had been ostensibly polishing, and whisking
round sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know what else you can call
it,&rdquo; put in Mrs Dewey indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure the men is hard enough to manage at the best o&rsquo; times,
an&rsquo; when a &rsquo;ooman like you goes encouragin&rsquo; of
&rsquo;em in their bad ways and wickedness, &rsquo;tis a shame
and a disgrace, Mrs Crumpler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A public shame, so &rsquo;tis,&rdquo; exclaimed
Jenny.&nbsp; Sally turned quite pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what have I done?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; echoed the deputation in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; repeated Sally, with a stamp
of the foot, and raising her voice so as to drown the
outcry.&nbsp; &ldquo;When my husband found hisself onfit to do
his work this marnin&rsquo; I went out an&rsquo; did it for en,
so as maister shouldn&rsquo;t turn en away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs Dewey, folding her arms,
&ldquo;that was what ye done; we all knows that well
enough.&nbsp; Ye was a-boastin&rsquo; an a-braggin&rsquo; of it
loud enough, I&rsquo;m sure, settin&rsquo; yourself up an
tryin&rsquo; to make every man o&rsquo; the place discontented
and upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs Crumpler indignantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I never opened my mouth to get
a-boastin&rsquo; or anything o&rsquo; the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t ye!&rdquo; retorted Jenny.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I heared my father say as you went an offered maister to
do two days&rsquo; work to make up for one your husband had
a-lost through bein&rsquo; drinky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined Sally, whose blood was now up,
&ldquo;that wasn&rsquo;t boastin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a-settin&rsquo; yourself up above the rest
of us and a-puttin&rsquo; notions into the men&rsquo;s heads what
be bad enough as &rsquo;tis,&rdquo; cried Mrs Dewey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;ll all be expectin&rsquo; of us to do
the same,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs Frost, &ldquo;to be sure they
will.&nbsp; The very next time Frost gets drunk he&rsquo;ll up
and ax me, as like as not, why I don&rsquo;t do his work for en,
same as Sally Crumpler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, Mr Crumpler, whose shoulders might have been
observed to heave during the last few moments, suddenly pushed
back his chair and burst into a roar of laughter.</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well
done, Sally!&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low there
b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t a man in the place but what envies
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the deputation turned upon him as one woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself?&rdquo; asked Mrs
Dewey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did ought to want to go and hide your head,&rdquo;
exclaimed Jenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sich a man as that didn&rsquo;t ought to look honest
folk i&rsquo; th&rsquo; face,&rdquo; remarked Mrs Frost
witheringly.</p>
<p>But Jarge laughed on, eyeing the three the while with so
quizzical an air that they were positively discomfited.&nbsp;
Finally he rose and made his way to the door&mdash;walking quite
straight by the way&mdash;and politely requested the ladies to
step out.</p>
<p>This they did, overturning a chair or two in their hasty
passage.</p>
<p>Jarge closed the door, but, apparently struck by a sudden
thought, opened it again and thrust his head through the
aperture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t ashamed o&rsquo; myself, good
souls,&rdquo; shouted Mr Crumpler after the retreating figures,
&ldquo;but I tell ye what&mdash;I be jist about proud o&rsquo; my
little &rsquo;ooman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Crumpler remained, however, somewhat discomposed by the
recent event, and when she took her way fieldwards again, it was
with a downcast countenance.&nbsp; Jarge would have accompanied
her, but for the fact that, though he had regained control of his
legs and could speak with comparative clearness, he continued to
see double.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>&ldquo;An&rsquo; that mid be a bit awk&rsquo;ard
wi&rsquo; so many harses about,&rdquo; he confided to Sally.</p>
<p>Moreover the wound in his head was sufficiently painful to
make a further rest advisable.&nbsp; Sally set forth therefore
alone, feeling tired and miserable enough.&nbsp; She was the most
modest little creature in the world, and was filled with dismay
at the notoriety she had so suddenly acquired.&nbsp; As the
afternoon advanced she shrank more and more into her shell, for
if the ill-will of the women had vexed and perturbed her, the
boisterous admiration of the men annoyed her almost beyond
endurance.&nbsp; The rough jests, the officious offers of aid,
the loudly expressed praise were equally obnoxious to her.&nbsp;
It was with unbounded relief that she saw the last waggon loaded,
and prepared to depart from the field.&nbsp; She had shaken out
her skirts, and was in the act of straightening her sunbonnet
when she found herself suddenly seized from behind, and almost
before she realised what was happening, was hauled by a dozen
strong grimy hands on to the apex of the piled-up hay and there
enthroned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for the Queen o&rsquo; the Day!&rdquo;
shouted someone, and the cry was taken up by a score of lusty
voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for the best wife in Riverton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me down,&rdquo; gasped Mrs Crumpler faintly; but an
extra pair of horses had been harnessed to the waggon, and it was
now rumbling forward at what seemed to her a dangerously rapid
rate.</p>
<p>There sat the poor little woman on her sweet-smelling throne,
the reluctant centre of all eyes, <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>while the waggon went out of the
field and down the village street surrounded by a shouting band
of haymakers.&nbsp; Outraged matrons stood in the doorways
raising indignant eyes to Heaven, delighted children ran after
the convoy, adding their shrill voices to the chorus; last of all
Jarge Crumpler himself, startled by the outcry, made his way to
his own gate just as the triumphal procession drew up before
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for the best wife in Riverton!&rdquo;
shouted Bill Frost; and &ldquo;Hooray, hooray!&rdquo; cried the
bystanders.</p>
<p>Jarge himself, infected by the enthusiasm, shouted
&ldquo;Hooray&rdquo; too, just as little Sally, very red in the
face, came sliding down from the waggon.</p>
<p>As she heard him she stopped for a second, threw a reproachful
glance at him, and then, bursting into smothered sobs, hurried
into the house.</p>
<p>After a pause of bewilderment he hastened after her, while the
haymakers, with a farewell cheer, continued their progress at a
more leisurely pace, with a dozen children clinging to the
tail-board of the waggon, and one or two of the more adventurous
perched on the load itself.</p>
<p>Sally was crouching behind the door with her apron over her
head, sobbing as if her heart would break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missus!&rdquo; said Jarge, becoming quite sober all at
once, and seeing only the very distinct outline of one little
sorrowful figure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Missus!&mdash;little
&rsquo;ooman!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>Sally
jerked down her apron and gazed at him with eyes that were fierce
through their tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did ought to be ashamed o&rsquo; yourself,&rdquo;
she cried brokenly.</p>
<p>Jarge looked down at her ruefully and drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>He repeated this statement on the following morning when he
presented himself to Farmer Ellery, humbly petitioning that his
fault might be overlooked, and promising to work an hour or two
&ldquo;extry&rdquo; every day to make up for the time which had
been lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I shouldn&rsquo;t like my missus to come out
a-workin&rsquo; any more,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>The farmer looked at him sharply, grunted, and finally
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you another chance,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know how long you&rsquo;ll keep
straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be a-goin&rsquo; for to turn over a new leaf,&rdquo;
said Jarge firmly, and to everyone&rsquo;s surprise he actually
did.</p>
<h2><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>ANN-CAR&rsquo;LINE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Lambing</span> time is a very important
epoch to farming folk, and particularly to farming folk in
Dorset.&nbsp; The popular idea which associates the advent of
these innocents with primroses and daffodils, budding hedges, and
all the other adjuncts of spring does not obtain in this
pre-eminently sheep-rearing county.&nbsp; It is in November when
days are at their shortest, when the earth is at its barest, when
cold rain falls, and not infrequently sleet or
&ldquo;snow-stuff,&rdquo; as it is locally called, that the
misguided younglings of the flock look their first upon a sodden
and gloomy world.&nbsp; Midway in October their quarters are got
in readiness, preferably in a corner of some upland field; the
shepherd&rsquo;s wheeled hut takes up its position in the midst
of a sheltered space in the lewth of the hedge, straw-padded
hurdles mark the enclosure, and sundry pens are made ready for
the new arrivals and their dams.&nbsp; By day the shepherd
himself may be seen, crook in hand and dog at heel, taking stock
of his premises; and often at dusk the uncertain light of his
lantern may be noted from afar.</p>
<p>On one particularly gloomy November evening young Timothy
Kiddle, Farmer Hounsell&rsquo;s new shepherd, made a careful
inspection of his charges, lantern in hand; and after completing
the tour of the fold sat down in an angle of the hurdle fence to
<a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>smoke a
quiet pipe.&nbsp; His hut had not yet been conveyed to its
destined site, and till now he had slept at home; but one of the
ewes seemed somewhat uneasy in her mind, and all things
considered Timothy decided that it would be better to spend the
night amid his charges.</p>
<p>He intended, of course, to watch, but having been
exceptionally busy all day, soon dozed, and presently indeed fell
into a sound sleep.&nbsp; This was no doubt highly reprehensible
under the circumstances, particularly when one remembers that a
lighted pipe was between his teeth, and that the whole place was
strewn with straw.</p>
<p>He awoke with a start and a terrific throb of conscience, and
was relieved to find himself in the dark; his pipe had dropped
harmlessly into his lap, and the very lantern had burnt itself
out.&nbsp; He rolled on to his knees, feeling cramped after his
long sitting, and was about to stand upright when his attention
was suddenly arrested by a curious sight.</p>
<p>At the further end of the long field, outlined against the
hedge, and thrown into strong relief by the light of a lantern
which stood on the ground beside her, was a girl, digging.&nbsp;
He could see her distinctly, and could even note that she wore a
white apron, that her sleeves were tucked up, and that she had no
hat or covering of any kind on her head.&nbsp; She laboured with
a will, but presently flung aside her spade, and, kneeling down,
drew something from her bosom which she thrust into the hole she
had made.&nbsp; As she bent over it, Timothy watching
breathlessly from his post behind the hurdles saw <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>and
recognised her face.&nbsp; It was Ann-Car&rsquo;line Bartlett,
who lived in one of the cottages down in the dip yonder.&nbsp;
Timothy had seen her several times, for she came regularly twice
a day to buy milk at Hounsell&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; She had even
seemed to him a nice, modest, quiet-spoken maid, and he wondered
much at the nature of the task she was now accomplishing.&nbsp;
Soon she was on her feet again, shovelling back the earth with
feverish energy; then, taking up her lantern, she stepped towards
the hedge, and stood there for a moment or two; but her back was
turned towards Timothy, and, crane his neck as he might, he could
not see what she was doing.&nbsp; Presently she turned about
again, caught up her spade, and, squeezing herself through a gap
in the hedge, walked away down the lane.</p>
<p>Timothy rose cautiously to his feet and looked after the
bobbing lantern till it vanished from his sight, and then,
feeling in his pocket for a fresh bit of candle, put it into his
lantern, lit it, and ran to inspect the mysterious spot.&nbsp;
First he examined the hedge, and after a minute scrutiny
discovered a small cross cut deep into the bark of a stout holly
sapling, which was evidently intended to serve as a landmark;
next, carefully inspecting the ground in the neighbourhood, he
came to the place where the earth had been recently
disturbed.&nbsp; The field was a turnip field, and it would have
been difficult on the morrow to distinguish the precise locality
without some such precaution as the girl had taken; as Timothy
knelt down to pursue his investigations he mentally commended her
wisdom.</p>
<p>Depositing his lantern on the ground he scratched <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>away the
loose earth with his vigorous hands, and presently came to a
little bundle.&nbsp; This, on being withdrawn and held to the
light, proved to be a cheap printed cotton handkerchief which was
carefully knotted about something hard and round.&nbsp; Timothy
breathlessly removed this outer covering, and discovered to his
astonishment a gold watch.&nbsp; A gentleman&rsquo;s gold watch,
as he said to himself, for it was a fairly large size, and there
was a monogram on the lid, and two or three seals and
charms&mdash;fallals Timothy dubbed them&mdash;appended to the
ring.</p>
<p>Timothy sat back on his heels, opening eyes and mouth in
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m dalled!&rdquo; he ejaculated under his
breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;That there nice, vitty little maid.&nbsp;
Who&rsquo;d ever think she&rsquo;d be that artful.&nbsp; And that
wicked!&rdquo; he added severely.</p>
<p>After turning about the watch, and examining it on every side,
he wrapped it up again, and restored it to its hiding-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must ha&rsquo; stole it,&rdquo; he said to himself,
as he threw in the earth again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certain sure, she
must ha&rsquo; stole it.&nbsp; A poor maid like her doesn&rsquo;t
ha&rsquo; gold watches to throw about.&nbsp; If it was given to
her she wouldn&rsquo;t go and bury it in a field half a mile away
from her home.&nbsp; No, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t very likely.&nbsp;
She stole it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s done, and
she&rsquo;ve a-hid it away here to keep it safe till she can pop
it, or maybe sell it.&nbsp; Nobody &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; knowed if
I hadn&rsquo;t chanced to look over the hurdle.&nbsp; It do
really seem quite providential,&rdquo; continued Timothy, who
loved to use a long word, now and then, even in communion with
himself, &ldquo;to think I should ha&rsquo; falled asleep, and my
<a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>lantern
should ha&rsquo; went out like that, else the maid &rsquo;ud
never ha&rsquo; dug so nigh to where I was
sittin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose to his feet now, stamping down the earth over the
filled-in hole, and then loosening the surface with the toe of
his big boot; as he turned away he laughed to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maid little thinks as I do know her secret.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll watch&mdash;ah, sure, I&rsquo;ll watch.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not wishful for to get her into trouble, but I&rsquo;ll
watch.&nbsp; When she comes to dig her treasure up again,
I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; summat for to say to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this resolution he made his way back to his charges; but
throughout his oft broken slumbers that night he was haunted by
the remembrance of Ann-Car&rsquo;line&rsquo;s secret; when he was
not in fancy holding the watch in his hand or replacing it in its
wrapper, he was sternly questioning the girl and receiving
numerous and widely differing explanations of the mystery.</p>
<p>When he went about his work at early dawn he frequently
glanced in the direction of the hiding place, and saw in
imagination the little round packet lying snug at the bottom of
its hole.&nbsp; A chance passer-by on the rough track on the
other side of the hedge made him start&mdash;would he be likely
to detect that the earth had been recently disturbed in that
particular spot which Timothy knew of?&nbsp; Even when Mr
Hounsell came up as usual to inspect the little flock, Timothy
was careful to place himself immediately in front of him,
whenever the farmer chanced to glance in the direction in
question; so that his own burly form might serve as a screen to
Ann-Car&rsquo;line&rsquo;s indiscretion.</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;What be you a-turnin&rsquo; and a-turnin&rsquo;
round me like that for?&rdquo; enquired his master presently,
with some sternness.&nbsp; &ldquo;There you do make I quite
giddy.&nbsp; You be jist same as a weathercock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timothy had no answer ready on the moment; he looked up at the
sky, and then at the distant horizon, and finally remarked that
he didn&rsquo;t think the wind was shiftin&rsquo; that much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say it be,&rdquo; responded the farmer
emphatically, &ldquo;but I do say as you mid be a weathercock the
way you do go on a-twistin&rsquo; and a-turnin&rsquo;&mdash;there
ye be again!&nbsp; What be the matter, man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timothy set his hat more firmly on his head, cleared his
throat, spat in his hands, and caught up a pitchfork, remarking
that there was a deal to be seen to, and that weathercock or no
weathercock, he ought to be shakin&rsquo; out the straw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; the ewes here as I
don&rsquo;t so very well like the looks on,&rdquo; he said
persuasively, jerking his thumb over his shoulder towards a
quarter which he felt to be perfectly safe.</p>
<p>Thereupon Mr Hounsell forgot to animadvert further on his
underling&rsquo;s oddities, and immediately became immersed in
more practical matters.</p>
<p>By chance the shepherd was obliged to betake himself to the
farm that day on some errand; and, as he was hurrying back to his
charges, he encountered Ann-Car&rsquo;line, leisurely driving a
flock of ducks towards a wayside pond.&nbsp; She had slung her
sun-bonnet on one arm, so that her pretty hair caught such pale
sunshine as was available on that November afternoon; and in one
hand she held a long elder switch with a few yellow leaves <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>dandling at
its extremity.&nbsp; She responded to Timothy&rsquo;s greeting
with perfect serenity, her placid blue eyes appearing more limpid
even than usual as she returned his gaze.&nbsp; When he was a few
paces away from her, picking his steps carefully among her
waddling flock, he heard her trill out a song as suddenly and
sweetly as a robin might have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that beats all!&rdquo; commented the
shepherd.&nbsp; &ldquo;There she do look I in the face so
innocent as a baby, and she do sing out like a&mdash;like a
angel.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t make nothing of it&mdash;nay, I
can&rsquo;t indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hut had now been put into position, and he occupied it
that night, and might have slumbered peacefully enough, for his
sheep were quiet; yet he could not rest for thinking of
Ann-Car&rsquo;line and her secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She mid ha&rsquo; found that watch,&rdquo; he said to
himself, &ldquo;or she midn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; knowed &rsquo;twas
wrong to take it.&nbsp; There, to think of it a-layin&rsquo; out
there so as anybody what liked mid just stretch out his hand and
take it.&nbsp; What &rsquo;ud the poor maid do then?&nbsp;
She&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; no chance of giving it back, or
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impelled by these reflections, Timothy presently got up and
made a second pilgrimage to Ann Car&rsquo;line&rsquo;s
hiding-place.&nbsp; In a very few minutes he had withrawn the
watch from its wrapper, dropped it into his own pocket, and
replaced it by a round smooth stone.&nbsp; He chuckled to himself
as he folded the handkerchief about this and laid it in the
hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be a rare treat to see the maid&rsquo;s
face,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>For greater safety he continued to carry the watch about his
person, carefully testing his pocket <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>night and morning to make quite sure
there was no suspicion of a hole.</p>
<p>The knowledge of this possession made him look quizzically at
Ann-Car&rsquo;line when next he came upon her; and strange to say
he found himself obliged to pass her house on the following
day.&nbsp; She was busily engaged in scrubbing the doorstep, and
on hearing his footfall turned round; and perceiving that he
smiled, though somewhat oddly, smiled back, gaily and innocently
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, to be sure!&rdquo; exclaimed Timothy, pausing;
&ldquo;you do seem in very good spirits, my maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so I be,&rdquo; replied the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
han&rsquo;t got nothing to make me sad, have I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you have,&rdquo; said
Timothy.&nbsp; &ldquo;You was a-singin&rsquo; yesterday so gay as
a lark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m often singin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sing all day if I was let; it do help
to pass the time away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sing and scrub, though, I
shouldn&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Timothy, tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; retorted Ann-Car&rsquo;line, and
immediately dipped her brush in the pail and simultaneously
lifted that marvellous clear voice of hers.&nbsp; It was a
marvellous voice&mdash;fresh and true and ringing; she could send
it up, up, to the very limit of the gamut, as it seemed, yet
never lose sweetness or roundness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I sing and scrub?&rdquo; she repeated,
pausing to take breath and to soap her brush afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heerd nothin&rsquo; like it!&rdquo; replied
Timothy, enthusiastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Says I to myself
yesterday, &lsquo;It mid be a angel singin&rsquo;,&rsquo; I
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, and did you?&rdquo; said Ann-Car&rsquo;line,
growing <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>pink with pleasure as she vigorously polished the
doorstep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did indeed,&rdquo; returned the shepherd
earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should think you was a angel&mdash;or
very near,&rdquo; he added hastily, for at that moment he chanced
to thrust his hand into his pocket, and came in contact with
something hard and round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very near&mdash;or, perhaps&mdash;I mid
say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mid ha&rsquo; been summat very like a angel,&rdquo;
replied Ann-Car&rsquo;line, squatting back on her heels and
looking at him seriously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mid ha&rsquo; been a
fairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she lowered her voice and looked round cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; enquired Timothy, stooping
over her and speaking in the same tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a secret.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let
mother hear ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd straightened himself again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,
you&rsquo;ve got secrets,&rdquo; he said dispassionately;
&ldquo;yes, young maids has secrets what they don&rsquo;t like
the wold folks to hear on.&nbsp; But secrets is dangerous, my
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereupon Timothy fingered the watch once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, what be so long a-doin&rsquo; for?&rdquo; called
out a sharp female voice from within the cottage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
could ha&rsquo; cleaned that doorstep forty times while
thou&rsquo;rt thinkin&rsquo; on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ann-Car&rsquo;line gathered up pail and brush, and hastened
indoors, leaving Timothy to meditate on her mysterious words as
he made his way towards the fold.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>He
frowned as he walked along, and struck at the hedge savagely with
his crook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairies is nonsense-folk!&rdquo; he exclaimed aloud
once and again; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think as thikky maid can be
so artful as she do seem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following Sunday, by some accident, he found himself
next her in church, and, perceiving that he had no hymn-book,
Ann-Car&rsquo;line was kind enough to permit him to share
hers.&nbsp; She looked as fair and innocent as a flower, and sang
with all her heart.&nbsp; Timothy was quite carried away.&nbsp;
Artful indeed!&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t her match in the whole
county of Dorset for looks, and he&rsquo;d go warrant she was as
good as she seemed.</p>
<p>When they emerged from the church he asked her to walk with
him, and before half an hour had passed had begun to court her in
form.&nbsp; He actually forgot, for the time being, all about the
watch and his suspicions connected with it, and it was not until
Ann-Car&rsquo;line had unexpectedly broken a somewhat long and
contented silence by a fragment of some gay little song&mdash;not
a hymn-tune&mdash;that he remembered the phrase which had so much
puzzled him a few days before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that you was a-sayin&rsquo; about bein&rsquo;
a fairy?&rdquo; he enquired, abruptly.</p>
<p>Ann-Car&rsquo;line&rsquo;s little white teeth flashed out in a
mischievous smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was axed once if I&rsquo;d like
to be a fairy,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye think
I&rsquo;d make a very good one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such folks as fairies,&rdquo; returned
Timothy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody couldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; axed ye
such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;They did though!&rdquo; retorted
Ann-Car&rsquo;line.&nbsp; &ldquo;Says they, &lsquo;You be a
pretty maid&mdash;you&rsquo;d make a very good fairy.&nbsp; Would
you like to be one?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s a nonsense tale,&rdquo; said the
shepherd firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not put up wi&rsquo; no
such stories.&nbsp; If you and me be to walk out, and
to&mdash;and to&mdash;carry on reg&rsquo;lar same as we&rsquo;ve
a-made up our minds to do, you did ought to have more respect for
I.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t ye be a-comin&rsquo; to I again wi&rsquo;
such made-up tales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed again in a queer, little secret way that
annoyed him still more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be truth between us,&rdquo; he said, almost
harshly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must tell me the truth about
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, looking at her oddly; he did not intend to let
her know how much he had found out for himself.&nbsp; She must
confess everything to him of her own accord, and then he would
stand by her through thick and thin.</p>
<p>Ann-Car&rsquo;line, however, did not seem in the least
impressed; she went on singing to herself under her breath,
glancing maliciously at Timothy from time to time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it if you don&rsquo;t believe
me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; more
as I can tell ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; at all?&rdquo; enquired the shepherd
sternly.&nbsp; He thought he saw her change colour, but she shook
her head emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Timothy fiercely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made a mistake, my girl, and &rsquo;tis best
to say so straight out.&nbsp; If ye can look I in the face and
tell I they things, ye b&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t the maid for I.&nbsp;
Ye can find somebody else to keep company wi&rsquo;.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d sooner live <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>lonesome all my days nor have a wife
as wasn&rsquo;t to be trusted; so I&rsquo;ll bid ye
good-day.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s one thing,&rdquo; he added,
turning round suddenly, &ldquo;ye may find yourself in trouble
sooner than ye think for, and ye may be glad enough to own up
then.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not be your sweetheart no more, but if
ever you&rsquo;re in trouble and will own up I&rsquo;ll stand by
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him for a moment oddly, half-fearfully, but
recovering herself, turned upon her heel, muttering something
about a likely tale, coupled with certain ejaculations intended
to prove her entire content with the actual condition of affairs,
and her scorn of the recalcitrant lover.</p>
<p>Timothy went home in high dudgeon, and taking out the watch
gave it a little indignant shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to put thee back where I found
thee,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, it &rsquo;ud serve her
right if I put thee back and took no more notice of either of
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But after a moment&rsquo;s fierce reflection he put the watch
back in his pocket again, and decided to wait.</p>
<p>Days passed and became weeks; Timothy frequently met
Ann-Car&rsquo;line, greeting her with a surly word or two, to
which she responded by a saucy nod; sometimes he would hear her
singing in the lanes, and would pause to listen when he thought
himself unnoticed; and on Sundays, though they no longer shared
the same hymn-book, his eyes frequently wandered to her face, and
he was forced to confess to himself that though he knew her to be
an artful, untruthful little maid, she looked, as he had so often
said, &ldquo;like a angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>At last
the long-expected actually came to pass.&nbsp; He woke up
suddenly, very early, one morning, and saw a lantern glimmering
at the further end of the field.&nbsp; He immediately rose, put
on his coat, and opening the door of the hut a little wider
peered out into the darkness.&nbsp; It was not yet five
o&rsquo;clock, and here in the open field all was still as at
midnight.&nbsp; The weather had &ldquo;taken up&rdquo; lately;
the keen crispness of frost was in the air, and the sky was full
of stars.&nbsp; The bobbing light yonder seemed to blink like one
at first, but presently became steady, and all at once he heard,
or fancied he heard, a faint cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s found the stone,&rdquo; said Timothy, and
grinned to himself.</p>
<p>Now the light began to waver again, and, as Timothy expected,
approached the hut.&nbsp; As it drew near,
Ann-Car&rsquo;line&rsquo;s voice was heard calling piteously,
&ldquo;Mr Kiddle!&nbsp; Timothy&mdash;Timothy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd winked to himself, and answered with a low and
muffled roar, intended to indicate that he had just been aroused
from profound slumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Timothy Kiddle!&rdquo; cried the voice,
&ldquo;please come out a minute, I don&rsquo;t know what to
do.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold hard a minute!&rdquo; cried Timothy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lighted his lantern and sallied forth.&nbsp; There stood
Ann-Car&rsquo;line, pressing close against the hurdle fence, the
light which she held up falling upon her white scared face, and
upon the handkerchief in her hand.</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>&ldquo;What be doin&rsquo; here, my maid, at this
hour?&rdquo; enquired the shepherd sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You did
ought to be at home and a-bed.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
respectable to be wanderin&rsquo; about in the fields in the
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be so cross,&rdquo; pleaded the
girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t come if I could help
it.&nbsp; Oh dear!&nbsp; Oh dear!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m in such
trouble.&nbsp; You said I was to call you if I was in
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said you was to own up,&rdquo; said Timothy,
grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must start wi&rsquo; that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be a bit kinder,&rdquo; moaned
Ann-Car&rsquo;line, and two big tears rolled down her
cheeks.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I had summat as I
didn&rsquo;t want the folks at home to see&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t
got nothin&rsquo; what locks&mdash;so I made a little hole at the
bottom of the field yon&mdash;and I buried it.&nbsp;
An&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;somebody&rsquo;s been an&rsquo;
stole it away, an&rsquo; put a stone in its place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer tale,&rdquo; said Timothy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very near as queer a tale as the one you did tell I about
bein&rsquo; axed to be a fairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it&rsquo;s true&mdash;it&rsquo;s really
true,&rdquo; cried Ann-Car&rsquo;line earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
the worst of it is the thing&mdash;what I hid&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timothy deliberately set down his lantern, and folded his arms
on the top of the hurdle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to come out wi&rsquo; the whole
truth, my girl,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what was the thing ye
hid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a watch,&rdquo; gasped the girl; &ldquo;a
gold watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timothy whistled under his breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
&rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t yours, ye say?&rdquo; he remarked after a
pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye stole it then, did ye?&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll
be put in prison so sure as I be a-lookin&rsquo; at
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;Stole it!&rdquo; ejaculated Ann-Car&rsquo;line
with a little scream.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did no such thing.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas give me, but I didn&rsquo;t want to take it an&rsquo;
I said I&rsquo;d give it back&mdash;and now I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
she added with a burst of woe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look ye here, maidie,&rdquo; cried Timothy, in a
voice that had suddenly grown extremely wrathful, &ldquo;this
&rsquo;ere tale&rsquo;s worse nor what I looked for.&nbsp; Who
gave ye that watch?&nbsp; Come, make a clean breast
on&rsquo;t&mdash;else I&rsquo;ll not lift a finger to help
ye.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll have to come out first or last, and
there&rsquo;s less shame in telling me&mdash;what&rsquo;s your
friend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ashamed,&rdquo; interrupted
Ann-Car&rsquo;line, throwing back her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
not done wrong.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a gentleman give me the watch,
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then you have done wrong!&rdquo; said the
shepherd, sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What right had ye to take gold
watches from gentlemen as ye dursen&rsquo;t let your mother
see.&nbsp; It bain&rsquo;t a very nice story, that.&nbsp; Who is
the gentleman?&rdquo; he added fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;What did he
give ye the watch for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing up to the hurdle he seized the girl by the wrists,
pinioning her fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, Timothy!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t pinch me so
vicious&mdash;you be hurtin&rsquo; I.&nbsp; There, &rsquo;twas a
actin&rsquo; gentleman what come wi&rsquo; a lot o&rsquo; others
to the town in the summer.&nbsp; They was actin&rsquo; a play at
the Corn Exchange, wi&rsquo; a lot o&rsquo; singin&rsquo; and
dancin&rsquo; in it.&nbsp; This one was the head o&rsquo; the
actin&rsquo; folks.&nbsp; I went there along o&rsquo; father, and
he said he see&rsquo;d me all the time the play was goin&rsquo;
on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father said that?&rdquo; queried Timothy,
sharply.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>&ldquo;No, the actin&rsquo; gentleman.&nbsp; He come
upon me the next day, walkin&rsquo; along the lane and
singin&rsquo;&mdash;as I mid be the first day you did talk to
I&mdash;and he did stop and speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; growled Timothy, tightening his
grip upon her wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he axed I a lot of questions, and he did say I
wer&rsquo; a very pretty girl, and he did ax I would I like to be
a fairy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was him said that,&rdquo; interrupted the
shepherd.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never thought there was a word o&rsquo;
truth in the tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was, though.&nbsp; He meant a play-actin&rsquo;
fairy, o&rsquo; course.&nbsp; He said all I&rsquo;d have to do
was to sing a bit, and dance a bit, and look nice, and I&rsquo;d
get a lot of money and see the world too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he said, and what did you say?&rdquo; asked Timothy,
as she paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First I said I didn&rsquo;t think mother could spare
me, and then I said I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d like it, and
then I said straight out I wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But he
wouldn&rsquo;t take No,&rdquo; said Ann-Car&rsquo;line, opening
her eyes very wide.&nbsp; &ldquo;The more I hung back, the more
he pressed&mdash;and at last he pulls out that watch an&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;Now, my dear, think it over.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be
comin&rsquo; back again about Christmas-time,&rsquo; he
says.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you from now to then to make
up your mind.&nbsp; And meanwhile there&rsquo;s my watch for you
to keep,&rsquo; says he&mdash;&lsquo;&rsquo;twill show you
I&rsquo;m in earnest, anyhow.&nbsp; You can mark the flight of
time with that,&rsquo; says he&mdash;he spoke so funny, ye
know&mdash;&lsquo;and with every day that passes you must be the
nearer to making up <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>your mind to sayin&rsquo;
Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it a queer notion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very queer notion, indeed,&rdquo; said Timothy,
grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, and now ye&rsquo;ve lost the
watch&mdash;and what be ye goin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; returned
Ann-Car&rsquo;line, sobbing afresh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall never be
able to look him in the face, when he comes for his
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said Timothy, rigidly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not be in such a hurry to meddle wi&rsquo;
young maids again, p&rsquo;raps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but he&rsquo;ll be sure to think I sold it, or
pawned it, or summat&mdash;he&rsquo;ll maybe have the law on
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all what&rsquo;s troublin&rsquo; ye?&rdquo;
said the shepherd, fixing her with a piercing gaze.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If anybody was to find that watch for ye, you
wouldn&rsquo;t want to go turnin&rsquo; into a fairy or any sich
tomfoolery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;indeed I
shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she cried earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
Timothy, will ye help me to find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but what I will,&rdquo; said
he&mdash;&ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll promise me&mdash;promise me
faithful&mdash;faithful, mind, not to take no more notice at all
of that play-actin&rsquo; gentleman.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll find that
watch if ye&rsquo;ll let me take it back to the man myself, and
tell en so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will&mdash;I&rsquo;ll promise,&rdquo; sobbed she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain!&rdquo; said Timothy,
firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now then&mdash;let&rsquo;s see what can be
done.&nbsp; Was there nobody at all in the field when you did
chance to bury that watch?&nbsp; Somebody must ha&rsquo;
see&rsquo;d ye do it, ye see, and then so soon as your back was
turned, gone and dug it up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there was nobody there,&rdquo; replied the girl, <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I watched and waited for
ever so long before I made the hole&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t a
sign of anybody.&nbsp; Your hut wasn&rsquo;t up here then&mdash;I
shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; done it if it had a-been there, for
I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been afeard ye mid see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Timothy, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
true.&nbsp; I mid ha&rsquo; seen ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nobody could tell where &rsquo;twas hid,&rdquo; she
pursued mournfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I scratched up the earth and
made it look same as all the rest o&rsquo; the field.&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; found it myself if I hadn&rsquo;t
ha&rsquo; made a little sign to know it by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sich as a mark in the hedge?&rdquo; suggested
Timothy.</p>
<p>She stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little cross, as mid be, cut in a holly stem?&rdquo;
continued the shepherd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-o-oh,&rdquo; cried Ann-Car&rsquo;line, &ldquo;you
horrid, unkind, teasin&rsquo; chap!&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low
you was spyin&rsquo; on me all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all answer Timothy dived to the depths of his pocket and
produced by slow degrees, first the chain, and then the watch
itself.</p>
<p>Ann-Car&rsquo;line, uncertain whether to be more angry or
relieved, burst into a series of disjointed exclamations, and
finally ordered her lover to give her back that watch
immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; of the kind,&rdquo; replied he, dropping
it into his pocket again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it for ye
same as I&rsquo;ve a-been doin&rsquo; all along.&nbsp; Says I to
mysel&rsquo; when I see&rsquo;d what you was
arter&mdash;&lsquo;That there maid&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo; into
trouble,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;wi&rsquo;out somebody
interferes.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&ldquo;Oh, Timothy, did ye?&rdquo; cried
Ann-Car&rsquo;line, melting all at once, &ldquo;but ye
needn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; gied me such a fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; had secrets from I,
then,&rdquo; returned he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll
ha&rsquo; no more secrets now, my girl, shall us?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll gi&rsquo;e that watch back to the chap and send en
about his business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll think it so queer, won&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; said she, simpering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not think it a bit queer when I do tell en
I be a-courtin&rsquo; of ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Timothy!&rdquo; sighed Ann-Car&rsquo;line.</p>
<p>And then Timothy Kiddle set his lantern on the ground, and,
leaning over the hurdles, kissed her with great earnestness and
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like having a thing settled!&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<h2><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>ONE
ANOTHER&rsquo;S BURDENS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Mrs Spencer picked her way
daintily along the path which led from the Frisbys&rsquo; little
gate to their house-door.&nbsp; The path in question had been
raked and was devoid of weeds, and if it had not been for a
presumably recent addition of bones and broken crockery in one
corner, and a large pool of dirty water, from which shallow
streams were slowly making their way to the gate aforesaid, would
no doubt have been tidy.&nbsp; The old lady hopped from side to
side in the attempt to keep her neat little feet dry, and when
she came to the pool itself, on which rings of suds were eddying,
stopped short with a disgusted air, and raising her voice, called
for Mrs Frisby.</p>
<p>The door slowly opened, and a slatternly-looking woman stood
upon the threshold.&nbsp; A stout two-year-old child sat on one
arm, while the other hand held a penny novelette.&nbsp; A wisp of
hair hung loosely over her face, which was as dirty as that of
the child; the bodice of her dress was held together by pins, and
she altogether presented a most uninviting appearance.&nbsp; She
started at sight of the visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, m&rsquo;m,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d known you was comin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
Thursday is a busy day with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; responded Mrs Spencer, suffering her
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>eyes to
wander over the woman&rsquo;s figure, and thence towards the
corner of the garden, where she could see some dingy-looking
clothes hanging on the line.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most people have
finished their washing by Thursday, but you are evidently in the
middle of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, m&rsquo;m,&rdquo; admitted Mrs Frisby,
dolefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, with all those childern, ye know,
m&rsquo;m, and Frisby coming in and making so much mess,
&rsquo;tis hard to get on with the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curious thing,&rdquo; remarked Mrs
Spencer, &ldquo;that you should prefer to empty your suds out of
the front door&mdash;and do you find you get on quicker with your
work if you read while you&rsquo;re doing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well &rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m sure, m&rsquo;m, I had but
just sat down for a minute.&nbsp; Little Harry was a bit peevish,
and I couldn&rsquo;t let him cry&mdash;he chanced to prick his
finger with a pin, ye see, m&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;d been a button there,&rdquo; said Mrs
Spencer, &ldquo;or a hook and eye, that accident couldn&rsquo;t
have happened.&nbsp; And pray&rdquo;&mdash;peering at the
dreadful little book with her sharp eyes&mdash;&ldquo;were you
reading &lsquo;Lady Selina&rsquo;s Lover&rsquo; out loud to amuse
the baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the confused pause which ensued, the little old lady
made a leap across the muddy space, and, waving Mrs Frisby on one
side, entered the house.&nbsp; Such a house!&nbsp; Dirty windows,
a dirty floor, a grate which had not been cleaned for several
days, and beneath which was such a pile of cinders and ashes that
the fire would scarcely burn.&nbsp; Everything in the room was
dusty, and in <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>the very middle of the floor lay a pair of man&rsquo;s
muddy boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I beg your pardon, m&rsquo;m,&rdquo;
said Mrs Frisby.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a dreadful untidy place
for you to come into.&nbsp; Dear to be sure, just look at
Frisby&rsquo;s boots!&nbsp; He&rsquo;ve left them there ever
since last night, and I can&rsquo;t get him to so much as clean a
window for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you really?&rdquo; said Mrs Spencer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll sit down, thank
you.&nbsp; So Frisby won&rsquo;t clean the windows or put his
boots on one side?&nbsp; Well, you know, there are some wives,
Mrs Frisby, who would think it a little hard to ask their
husbands to clean windows when he had been working all day, and
who would even put away his boots if he did chance to leave them
on the floor.&nbsp; The husband, after all, is the
breadwinner.&nbsp; Frisby works very hard&mdash;I&rsquo;ll say
that for him&mdash;and he&rsquo;s earning good wages, and is
always ready to earn a little more by doing odd jobs after
hours.&nbsp; Then, when he&rsquo;s finished those, he has his
allotment to see to, and the garden here, which would, I see, be
very tidy if you did not allow your children to strew things all
over the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m always telling the childern
not to throw their rubbish about,&rdquo; said Mrs Frisby,
tearfully, &ldquo;but what am I to do?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t be
indoor and out too.&nbsp; Frisby might very well see to the
childern in the garden, I think, when I&rsquo;m busy in the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all Frisby&rsquo;s fault, in fact,&rdquo;
said Mrs Spencer, pursing up her lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
suppose,&rdquo; she added, looking round the room, &ldquo;he
ought to <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>dust, and clean the grate, and scrub the floors
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady spoke so seriously that Mrs Frisby stared hard
without replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; continued the former, after a pause,
&ldquo;your husband has worked on my estate for nearly ten
years&mdash;since he was quite a little boy, in fact&mdash;and I
have always found him extremely industrious, good-tempered, and
obliging.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t understand how it is that you seem
to give him such a different character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well &rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Mrs Frisby, shifting the
child from her right arm to her left, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
altogether complain, but I do think Frisby might be a bit more
good-natured, knowin&rsquo; how poorly I feel, and so many
childern to see to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody told me,&rdquo; said Mrs Spencer, &ldquo;that
Frisby very often helps to dress the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well &rsquo;m, and if he do they&rsquo;re his childern
so well as mine.&nbsp; I get faint now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you by any chance ever open a window here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Frisby burst into tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think &rsquo;tis
very hard o&rsquo; Frisby to go complainin&rsquo; of me,&rdquo;
she sobbed.&nbsp; &ldquo;A body can but do their best.&nbsp; With
four childern and such poor health as I have, I think it&rsquo;s
wonderful I can get along at all.&nbsp; And as to cleanin&rsquo;
up after Frisby (casting a sour look at the boots), I&rsquo;m
sure I can&rsquo;t be expected to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Mrs Spencer, turning sharply
round and walking out of the house.</p>
<p>As she drew near her own home she came upon Frisby himself,
looking hot and tired, and walking <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>with a lagging step.&nbsp; There had
been no preparations of any kind for dinner at his cottage, and
she wondered if the poor man would be obliged to get it himself,
while his wife read her trashy paper, and dandled the big child,
which could perfectly well have been taught to amuse itself
happily while its mother was busy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been to your house,&rdquo; she
remarked, as she came up to him.</p>
<p>Poor Frisby murmured something about wishing he had known, and
fearing she had found things a bit upset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen to me, James,&rdquo; said the old
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known you too long to let you go
downhill so fast without trying to help you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
been turning over a plan in my mind, which may possibly make that
wife of yours think a little more seriously of her
duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James got red, but listened in silence while Mrs Spencer began
to talk in a low rapid voice.&nbsp; He looked more and more
astonished as she proceeded, and finally burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twould be a good notion,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;a very good notion, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it for a week,&rdquo; said Mrs Spencer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I ask, try it for a week; I&rsquo;ll
undertake that you shan&rsquo;t be the loser, and of course you
must not say a word to your wife about having met me.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis past six, Jim,&rdquo; said Mrs Frisby on the
following morning, as she stood by the bed, after having
reluctantly clothed herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t ye hear
church-clock go?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>&ldquo;I heard it,&rdquo; said Jim drowsily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not feelin&rsquo; so very well, this
mornin&rsquo;, my dear; I don&rsquo;t think I can get
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Frisby, in real alarm, questioned him as to the nature of
his malady.&nbsp; Did his head ache&mdash;was his back
bad&mdash;was he feeling his heart any ways queer?</p>
<p>Her husband, after reflecting for a moment or two, replied
that it was just &ldquo;all-overishness,&rdquo; and that he
thought a rest would do him good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs Frisby, &ldquo;but I
haven&rsquo;t a drop of water in the house.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s to
fill the bucket at the well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to do it,
Sally,&rdquo; returned Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very
unfortunate&mdash;very, I&rsquo;m sure, but I can&rsquo;t think
how else it is to be managed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to do it, then,&rdquo; cried
Sally.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never heerd of such a thing!&nbsp; You
great lazy fellow, lying in bed with nothing the matter with
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; repeated Jim, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
all-overish, same as you be so often.&nbsp; My heart don&rsquo;t
feel quite right neither.&nbsp; If ye was to bring me up a cup of
tea, same as I do when you&rsquo;re not feeling yourself, I fancy
it might just keep it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye expect me to go cartin&rsquo; your breakfast
upstairs you&rsquo;re much mistaken,&rdquo; said Sally.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a poor eater myself at best of times, and I
don&rsquo;t care whether I have my breakfast or not.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ll not go drawin&rsquo; water for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pipe o&rsquo; baccy is as good as a breakfast to me
any day,&rdquo; said Jim, reaching out his hand for his
pipe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dare say I&rsquo;d be well enough to mind
the <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>childern while you was busy, Sally,&rdquo; he
continued, mildly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can manage the childern very
well.&nbsp; You can turn &rsquo;em all in here while you&rsquo;m
a-cleanin&rsquo; up.&nbsp; P&rsquo;raps &rsquo;tis just as well I
should be at home once in a way,&rdquo; he added,
pleasantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You always say you can never get on
wi&rsquo; your work wi&rsquo; the little ones in your way.&nbsp;
Now they&rsquo;ll be out o&rsquo; your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye can fetch childern yourself if you want them,&rdquo;
retorted Mrs Frisby, marching indignantly downstairs.</p>
<p>Jim crept cautiously out of bed and went to the window,
chuckling to himself as he presently saw her laboriously filling
her bucket at the well.&nbsp; He dressed himself with great speed
and dexterity for one in his delicate condition, and, going into
the adjoining rooms, roused the children and washed and dressed
the younger ones, directing the others to do the same for
themselves.</p>
<p>When he brought them downstairs presently, the kettle was
already boiling, and Mrs Frisby, with a flushed face was getting
down the teapot; if truth be told, she was not at all averse to
her breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time,&rdquo; observed Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t take so very long, you see, my dear, to get the
childern dressed if ye take a bit o&rsquo; trouble wi&rsquo;
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; Now, shan&rsquo;t we put a cloth on the
table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally murmured indistinctly something about lazy people not
deserving to be cocked up with cloths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning me?&rdquo; said Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me
what pays for the cloths, though.&nbsp; See, Rosie, it&rsquo;s
yonder on the dresser.&nbsp; Take it down, there&rsquo;s a good
little maid, and spread it nice&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>&ldquo;If ye can&rsquo;t do your own work, I
don&rsquo;t see why ye need come interfering with mine,&rdquo;
remarked Sally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve more time to see to things when I
don&rsquo;t go out to work myself,&rdquo; explained her
husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to train Rosie a bit.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s getting a big girl, now, and could easy learn to be
useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to work!&rdquo; gasped
Sally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel up to my work to-day, you
see,&rdquo; said Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just sit quiet in a
corner and rest me.&nbsp; Have you got a book handy?&nbsp; What
have you done with that nice book you were reading
yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very ill-done of you to make a mock of
me,&rdquo; cried his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you
didn&rsquo;t ought to grudge me the little bit of amusement I
took after working so hard all day&mdash;washing and
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t grudge it to you, my dear,&rdquo;
responded Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to imitate you,
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; I work hard, week by week, month by
month, and year by year.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to take a bit of
amusement now, and I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t grudge it to
me.&nbsp; Now then, Rosie, set the cups out, and the
plates&mdash;the cups at the top, ye know, and the plates all
round.&nbsp; Jack, fetch Daddy&rsquo;s boots there, and
I&rsquo;ll tell ye what to do with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little boy obeyed, and Jim in spite of his feeble state,
found himself able to take the child out to the shed at the back,
and there instruct him in the art of boot-cleaning, of which he
proved himself a capable scholar.&nbsp; By the time they returned
breakfast was ready.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Mrs
Frisby looked up with an attempt at a smile as they came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you are better,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll be able to go to work after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim shook his head with a despondent air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use expectin&rsquo; too much,&rdquo; he remarked,
quoting one of his wife&rsquo;s favourite speeches; then, as she
stared, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll jist see to the little uns an&rsquo;
help ye a bit with the cleanin&rsquo; if I don&rsquo;t find it
knocks me up too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Frisby finished her breakfast in silence, and Jim, after
disposing of his meal, turned his attention to the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, let&rsquo;s see how useful you can make
yourselves.&nbsp; See, I&rsquo;ll carry the things over to the
sink, and Rosie can wash &rsquo;em up, and Jack here can dry
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em smashed to atoms,&rdquo;
said Sally sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it; they&rsquo;re a deal more in danger of
getting smashed lying about, as they generally do, half the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He superintended the carrying out of both operations, and then
desired the children to wash their hands and smooth their hair
before going to school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he clumsily tied a
pinafore string.&nbsp; &ldquo;All your things do seem in
terr&rsquo;ble need of mendin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I tell ye what,
Sally, while you do a bit o&rsquo; cleanin&rsquo; up I&rsquo;ll
see if I can&rsquo;t make shift to sew on a button or
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>&ldquo;I thought you was too bad to work!&rdquo;
exclaimed Sally tartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody can do a bit o&rsquo; sewin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, my dear, as soon as ye&rsquo;ve taken away
tea-things, ye can begin on the grate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having procured needle and cottons and a card of buttons, a
trifle damaged on account of Baby Harry having been allowed to
chew it on the day it had been bought, Jim set to work, while Mrs
Frisby reluctantly knelt down before the hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take out the big cinders, Sally,&rdquo; he directed,
&ldquo;and put &rsquo;em on one side.&nbsp; It &rsquo;ud save ye
a deal o&rsquo; trouble,&rdquo; he continued mildly, &ldquo;if
ye&rsquo;d do it first thing in the morning, for then the
children &rsquo;ud give ye a helpin&rsquo; hand.&nbsp; Now I
think,&rdquo; said Jim, leisurely threading his needle,
&ldquo;that we&rsquo;ll have a bit o&rsquo; black-lead, my
dear.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s wonderful what a difference it makes to
the look of a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally worked away in gloomy silence, and Jim sewed on buttons,
and whistled under his breath.&nbsp; If truth be told he soon
grew extremely tired of the operation, and longed to be digging
potatoes or hoeing weeds.&nbsp; He continued, however, to direct
his wife, and, though Mrs Frisby felt herself very much
aggrieved, she did not dare to disobey his orders.</p>
<p>Presently the couple migrated to the bedrooms, for Jim found
himself so indisposed he was obliged to lie down while Sally gave
the three rooms a thoroughly good cleaning.&nbsp; Angry as she
was it was wonderful how quickly she managed to <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>get through
her work on that particular morning, for with Jim&rsquo;s eye
upon her she could neither sit down to read, nor stand staring
out of the window.</p>
<p>Jim, meanwhile, had taken charge of little Harry, and though
he neither dandled him nor played with him, he contrived so well
to teach him how to amuse himself that the child was quite
happy.&nbsp; It was true he found time to say an encouraging word
now and then to the little fellow, and made a safe plaything for
him out of three or four empty cotton reels securely fastened to
a piece of white tape.&nbsp; These Harry could rattle, or slide
up and down, and they were safer to chew than linen buttons on a
shiny green card.</p>
<p>After dinner Jim thought the air might do him good.&nbsp; He
strolled out into the garden, therefore, itching to be at work,
but resolutely keeping himself in check; and presently he invited
Sally to clean herself and bring her sewing out there too.</p>
<p>By and by Mrs Frisby joined him, looking quite tidy, and
gazing almost in alarm at her husband.&nbsp; She half expected
him to request her to do a bit of gardening, but he only smiled
as she approached, and told her she looked downright bonny with
her face so nice and clean; more like the girl he used to court
in by-gone days than he ever thought to see her again.</p>
<p>Putting his arm round her he made her sit down on the little
bench beneath the apple-tree, and there the couple passed an hour
or two in great content, <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>till Sally remarked that it was time
to go in and get tea ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;and mind ye sweep up the
hearth, my dear.&nbsp; It do make it look more
cheerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hearth actually was swept up when he entered, and all the
children sitting round the table with smooth hair and clean faces
and hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we was to get a door-mat it would keep the place
nicer,&rdquo; Sally observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could train the
childern to wipe their feet on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She announced this fact with the air of one who had made an
important discovery, and Jim, delighted with the turn affairs
were taking, agreed with alacrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It puts more heart into a man if he finds things is
made good use of; but when you go spendin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
spendin&rsquo; all what you&rsquo;ve worked hard for to get,
knowin&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll be let fall to pieces for want of a
stitch, or else ruined with rust and dirt, you have no pride or
pleasure in doin&rsquo; anythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally did not answer, but looked penitently at her
husband.</p>
<p>After tea, when the children were in bed she came and stood by
his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope ye&rsquo;ll be able to go to work
to-morrow,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a bad thing when ye come to think on&rsquo;t,
Sally, for the man to be laid by&mdash;him as has to earn the
money to fill all the little mouths.&nbsp; Wet or dry, sick or
well, off he has to go to his work.&nbsp; If a man didn&rsquo;t
do his work reg&rsquo;lar he&rsquo;d get turned off pretty
quick.&nbsp; <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>The women don&rsquo;t remember that when they sit idle
at home, without ever giving a thought to their husbands&rsquo;
peace or comfort.&nbsp; Yet, if the husbands wasn&rsquo;t there,
what would become of them all?&nbsp; Did you find it hard work
fillin&rsquo; that bucket this mornin&rsquo;, Sally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terr&rsquo;ble hard,&rdquo; said Sally, with a
quivering lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m sorry for that.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye think
ye&rsquo;ll be able to chop sticks for to-morrow&rsquo;s
fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye oughtn&rsquo;t to ask me to do such work,&rdquo;
said she, with a sob.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye know I&rsquo;m not fit for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winter an&rsquo; summer, year in, year out, I fill that
bucket&mdash;and every evenin&rsquo;, no matter how tired I may
be, I chop them sticks.&nbsp; When I had the lumbago last year, I
filled your bucket all the same, and when I sprained my wrist I
managed to use the chopper with my left hand.&nbsp; Yet, if
you&rsquo;ve the least little ache or pain, you never do a
hand&rsquo;s turn, Sally.&nbsp; I ask you straight, is that
fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally gazed at him in silence, her lip still trembling, her
eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; if ye&rsquo;d take a bit o&rsquo; pride in
yourself an&rsquo; the childern,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;d be some pleasure in comin&rsquo; home.&nbsp;
Yes, and I&rsquo;d be glad, too, to save up an&rsquo; take ye for
an outing now and again.&nbsp; But when I look at ye with the
clothes dropping off ye, and a face that hasn&rsquo;t as much as
nodded at cold water, I feel&mdash;well, I feel that, if I
wasn&rsquo;t a proper temperance man, it&rsquo;s to the public
I&rsquo;d go every night of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally looked down still without speaking.</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;Just think of it,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;you
have your share of work, no doubt; but I have mine too.&nbsp; If
we each do our own, and pull together, we can get along right
enough.&nbsp; Come, little &rsquo;ooman, see how nice
you&rsquo;ve made the place look&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t take so
very long, did it?&nbsp; An&rsquo; what a lot of mendin&rsquo; ye
did this afternoon&mdash;not to mention the buttons I sewed on
for ye,&rdquo; he added, with a twinkle in his
eye&mdash;&ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t so very much trouble once ye set
about it.&nbsp; Now, shall we make a fresh start?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll go to work to-morrow morning if you&rsquo;ll get out
your needles and thread, and throw them nasty silly story books
in the fire.&nbsp; And let&rsquo;s make the childern useful, my
dear&mdash;a little bit o&rsquo; light work is as good as play to
a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally glanced up with an odd look, in spite of the tears that
were still upon her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard ye make such a long speech in your life,
Jim,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;I wonder if
anybody&rsquo;s been putting you up to all the games you&rsquo;ve
been playing this day.&nbsp; Mrs Spencer now&mdash;she called
here yesterday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; said Jim, beginning to laugh a
little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth, Sally,
the notion did come from her.&nbsp; Ye mustn&rsquo;t be vexed, my
dear; but I think &rsquo;twas a good notion.&nbsp; &lsquo;If ever
any folks should bear one another&rsquo;s burdens,&rsquo; says
the mistress, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s husband and wife.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Come, Sally, I&rsquo;ll do my best for you if you&rsquo;ll do
your best for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally dried her eyes, and held out her hand to her husband:
&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She actually kept her resolution, and Jim had <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>good reason
to be grateful to his mistress for that happy thought of hers,
though he sometimes said with a laugh, that she had taught him a
lesson too, and that he would rather plant cabbages all day than
sew on a dozen buttons.</p>
<h2><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>HOW
NED BLANCHARD EMIGRATED</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Alice Blanchard</span> was wheeling the
perambulator slowly along the most rutty curve of the
&ldquo;Drove,&rdquo; or steep lane which led from the high road
to the downs, when she caught sight of her father&rsquo;s sturdy
figure behind the almost leafless hedge.&nbsp; Farmer Bolt was a
short, thick-set man, with more brown in hair and beard than was
usual in a man of his years, and with a corresponding amount of
unlooked-for vigour and energy in his sturdy frame.&nbsp; He was
at work now on a task that would have been despised by most men
of his standing.&nbsp; He was clipping one of his own hedges in
fact, wielding his bill-hook with a rapidity and dexterity which
did not prevent his keeping a sharp look-out on the movements of
the men who were carting swedes at the further end of the
field.</p>
<p>Alice wedged the &ldquo;pram&rdquo; firmly against the bank,
pulled on the baby&rsquo;s hood, which had fallen back, arranged
its golden fluff of hair so that a becoming tuft appeared beneath
the frill, and then going to the other end of the small vehicle
made little Abel sit straight and smoothed out the creases in his
pinafore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve got your face all of a mess wi&rsquo;
blackberries,&rdquo; she said, in a vexed tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know whatever granfer&rsquo;ll think of
&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; There, I reckoned <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>to tidy thee up in grandma&rsquo;s
room afore he see&rsquo;d thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Abel was strapped fast in his seat, and could by no
possibility have procured the blackberries without his
mother&rsquo;s aid, the reproach seemed a trifle unreasonable;
but as Abel had not yet reached a time of life when he could
discourse on feminine inconsequence, he merely smiled broadly,
and repeated the word &ldquo;b&rsquo;ackberries&rdquo; in an
expectant tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless your little heart,&rdquo; said Alice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s granfer, look-see, t&rsquo;other side
o&rsquo; the hedge.&nbsp; Ye must call out &lsquo;granfer,&rsquo;
when we get a-nigh en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook out her own dress, a somewhat faded print, and set
her hat straight, apparently anxious to present as brave an
appearance in her father&rsquo;s eyes as in former days she had
to those of her admirers.</p>
<p>A few years ago Alice Bolt had been the handsomest girl in the
parish, and even now, though her figure had lost much of its
roundness, and her curly dark hair was arranged with less skill,
was pretty enough to call for a second glance from all who passed
her.</p>
<p>But her blue eyes had acquired a scared look of late, and the
bloom had faded in her cheeks.&nbsp; What else was to be
expected?&nbsp; The wolf was always at the door, and the fear of
it was perpetually present in the heart of the wife and
mother.</p>
<p>Farmer Bolt, in the intervals of chopping at his twigs and
superintending the leisurely tossing of &ldquo;roots&rdquo; into
the cart, found time to scan the <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>windings of the Drove, and had
indeed observed his daughter long before she had caught sight of
him.&nbsp; It may be presumed that he took note of her hasty
endeavours to make herself and her family presentable, yet he
appeared to be absorbed in his own labours when she halted
beneath the bank on which he was stationed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be that you, father?&nbsp; Look, Abel, look-see,
&rsquo;tis granfer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Bolt parted the thin screen of shoots surmounting the hedge
and peered over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis you, be it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me.&nbsp; I be just goin&rsquo; down to the
house to have a chat wi&rsquo; mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
<p>He lifted his bill-hook and examined it as though he had never
set eyes on it before; then he ran his finger thoughtfully along
the edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s granfer, look-see,&rdquo; repeated Alice
in a tone of assumed cheerfulness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at
granfer&rsquo;s hedgin&rsquo; hook, Abel!&nbsp; Call
&lsquo;Granfer,&rsquo; lovey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gran-fer!&rdquo; cried Abel, obediently.</p>
<p>It was the first time his grandfather had heard the child
pronounce an articulate word, and at sound of it he was unable to
resist the impulse to lean forward a little more and gaze down at
the perambulator and its occupants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learnt to talk, has he?&rdquo; he enquired,
ungraciously enough, yet eyeing the little fellow with a sort of
curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he can only say a few words,&rdquo; explained the
mother, almost stammering in her haste to bring out the
information before the grandfather&rsquo;s interest <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>had
waned.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Granfer&rsquo; was one o&rsquo; the
first words he said.&nbsp; He says it very plain, don&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plain enough,&rdquo; responded the farmer, gruffly, and
he let the twigs which he had been holding slap back again into
their ordinary position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ve come on a good bit since ye see&rsquo;d him
last,&rdquo; hazarded the mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Folks about us
thinks he&rsquo;s come on wonderful.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ye think
he&rsquo;s come on, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father parted the screen of twigs again, and as the
bearded face was thrust forth once more, Abel junior tilted
himself back in his place and gleefully shouted
&ldquo;Cuckoo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the life of him the grandfather could not help
smiling.&nbsp; He did not speak, but gazed at the child for a
moment or two, the lines of his countenance relaxing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cuckoo!&rdquo; cried Abel junior, anxiously watching
the upper twigs of the hedge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks you&rsquo;m playin&rsquo; a game wi&rsquo;
en,&rdquo; explained the mother tremulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Farmer Bolt, reflectively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do he?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more in my line to work nor to
play though.&rdquo;&nbsp; He loosed the twigs which immediately
flew back into place, and Baby Abel, imagining that this was done
solely for his benefit cried &ldquo;Cuckoo!&rdquo; again, and
watched the top of the hedge with dancing eyes.&nbsp; When the
farmer, with apparent inadvertence, looked forth again, he threw
himself back once more with uproarious laughter, kicking out at
the same time with sturdy little feet, clothed in very battered
boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He do seem a jolly little chap too,&rdquo; said the <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>elder Abel,
with the air of one making a concession.&nbsp;
&ldquo;T&rsquo;other&rsquo;s a girl, bain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, she&rsquo;s a girl.&nbsp; I called en Margaret
after mother, same as the bwoy be Abel after you.&nbsp; We do
think little Abel terr&rsquo;ble like you, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer surveyed his descendant dubiously; and the two
pairs of blue eyes met; the child&rsquo;s twinkled in expectation
of the renewal of the game, and by-and-by the old man&rsquo;s
began to twinkle too.&nbsp; As he glanced at the baby, however,
his face clouded over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maid be a regular Blanchard, though,&rdquo; he
said, in a vexed tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yellow hair an&rsquo;
all.&nbsp; There, when she do laugh she be the very image of her
grammer, what used to drive a little donkey-cart wi&rsquo; rags
and bwones, an&rsquo; sich, an&rsquo; what died in the
Union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child can&rsquo;t help that, an&rsquo; neither can
Ned,&rdquo; said Alice, with a sudden flash in her eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The poor body did die when he were quite a little
chap.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas none of his fault if she did die in the
Union.&nbsp; So soon as he could work he kept hisself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It mid be none of his fault that his mother was what
she was, but I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low &rsquo;tis your fault that my
grandson should be what he is, belonging to trampin&rsquo; folks,
wi&rsquo; a father as was born i&rsquo; the Union, and
as&rsquo;ll die i&rsquo; the Union I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder.&nbsp; Did ever anybody see a &rsquo;ooman so downtrod as
what you be, an&rsquo; you as was such a handsome maid.&nbsp; Why
can&rsquo;t the chap keep ye in a bit more comfort now he&rsquo;s
got ye?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a deal o&rsquo; trouble, father,&rdquo;
faltered <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>Alice.&nbsp; &ldquo;What wi&rsquo; the childer
comin&rsquo; so fast, an&rsquo; what wi&rsquo; Ned breakin&rsquo;
his leg this spring, we&rsquo;ve been put about
terr&rsquo;ble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no use cryin&rsquo; about spilt
milk,&rdquo; said her father, roughly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye took the
crooked stick an&rsquo; now ye must put up wi&rsquo; en.&nbsp;
You as mid ha&rsquo; married as well an&rsquo; better nor any
maid i&rsquo; the place, ye must go an&rsquo; take up wi&rsquo; a
beggarly feller as I hired out o&rsquo; charity to begin
wi&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned always worked hard for his wage,&rdquo;
interpolated Alice, hotly, &ldquo;always!&nbsp; He was worth the
money ye paid en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, but I didn&rsquo;t know that at first.&nbsp; I
took en straight fro&rsquo; the Union wi&rsquo;out no more
character nor what the master up yonder could give en.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; when I did do that I didn&rsquo;t look to bein&rsquo;
robbed o&rsquo; my only child.&nbsp; There, there&rsquo;s no use
talkin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I must get on wi&rsquo; my work.&nbsp; Get
along and chat wi&rsquo; mother if ye want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cuckoo!&rdquo; cried little Abel as the twigs were once
more released; but Granfer did not respond.&nbsp; After an
admonitory shout to one of the carters who had spent what he
considered an undue time in consideration of the horizon, he
resumed his labours with the bill-hook.</p>
<p>Mrs Blanchard trundled her perambulator onwards with a sore
heart and an anxious face.&nbsp; Her transient anger had left
her, and she reproached herself for having lost her temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a bad start,&rdquo; she thought, ruefully,
&ldquo;a very bad start.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I&rsquo;ve
spoilt my chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Bolt was peeling potatoes when her daughter came to the
door, but she laid down her knife with <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>an
exclamation of delight when she caught sight of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis never you, my dear, so early an&rsquo; all,
an&rsquo; sich a long ways to come!&nbsp; To think o&rsquo; your
travellin&rsquo; seven mile at this time o&rsquo;
marnin&rsquo;!&nbsp; Dear, to be sure, how Abel have come
on!&nbsp; There, I never see&rsquo;d a child shoot up like
that.&nbsp; Bless his little heart, he be a fine child.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; Baby too, she be a-comin&rsquo; on jist
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel the weight of her,&rdquo; said Alice, taking the
child out of the perambulator and laying her in her
mother&rsquo;s arms; there was a pretty flush in her face and a
light in her eyes.</p>
<p>Mrs Bolt weighed her small namesake, and uttered various
disjointed exclamations of rapture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She be gettin&rsquo; sich a lot o&rsquo; hair,
look-see,&rdquo; continued the proud mother, jerking off the
child&rsquo;s hood.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; she&rsquo;s got two
teeth very near through.&nbsp; She be cuttin&rsquo; them early,
bain&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; An&rsquo; sich a good baby.&nbsp; There,
she do sleep right through the night, an&rsquo; by day when
I&rsquo;m busy at my work, ye know, she&rsquo;ll sit an&rsquo;
suck at her titty wi&rsquo;out a murmur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She be a-lookin&rsquo; for it now,&rdquo; remarked
grandma.</p>
<p>The much chewed indiarubber ring was unearthed from beneath
the baby&rsquo;s cape, and the flat lozenge-shaped adjunct
thereto thrust into her mouth, both women laughing delightedly on
noting its possessor&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, my dear, an&rsquo; sit down, do,&rdquo; said
Mrs Bolt.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure ye must be jist about
tired.&nbsp; Come, Abel love, an&rsquo; see what grandma&rsquo;s
got for &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; A ripe apple won&rsquo;t do en no
harm,&rdquo; she <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>added, turning to Alice.&nbsp; &ldquo;They golden
pippins be beautiful to-year&mdash;jist so sweet as honey.&nbsp;
I do r&rsquo;ally think that dear child favours his
granfer,&rdquo; she exclaimed, as having reached the living-room,
she divested Abel of his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish father &rsquo;ud take to en!&rdquo;
ejaculated Alice, dropping into the elbow-chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
met en jist now hedgin&rsquo; in the Drove.&nbsp; He did seem to
notice him a bit at first, but then he turned nasty about Ned as
he do always do, an&rsquo; began glenin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
carryin&rsquo; on about the Union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, love, don&rsquo;t ye mind en; ye do want a lot
o&rsquo; patience wi&rsquo; father.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis what I do
always say.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s to know it if not me?&nbsp; But
he&rsquo;ll come round in time&mdash;he&rsquo;ll come
round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis easy to say &lsquo;in time,&rsquo;&rdquo;
groaned poor Alice, &ldquo;but we do find it so hard to get on
now, mother.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve a-had sich bad luck, ye see.&nbsp;
Ned had to spend the bit o&rsquo; money he&rsquo;d saved on the
furniture we wanted, an&rsquo; stockin&rsquo; the
garden&mdash;&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t as if we&rsquo;d anybody to help
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Bolt eyed her daughter compassionately.&nbsp; She was a
good-looking, fresh-coloured woman, with a kindly, good-natured
face.&nbsp; Her daughter resembled her in complexion and build,
but not in disposition, for Mrs Bolt was placid and easy-going,
while Alice had inherited her father&rsquo;s energy and quickness
of temper.&nbsp; Mrs Bolt had been as much grieved as her husband
at Alice&rsquo;s unprosperous marriage, but, having protested in
vain, resigned herself to the inevitable, and had indeed forgiven
her daughter before the ceremony took place.&nbsp; Mr Bolt, too,
had, to outward seeming, <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>become reconciled with his daughter,
though he steadily refused to permit her husband to cross the
threshold, and to help the hapless couple in any way.&nbsp;
Alice, too, was proud, and when her mother would have
surreptitiously bestowed on her sundry dozens of eggs and pecks
of potatoes, she had rejected the gifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo;
father&rsquo;s wi&rsquo;out his consent,&rdquo; she said once,
bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; you do know so well as me,
he&rsquo;d rather let us all starve nor help Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very hard, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mrs
Bolt, now in a commiserating tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did hope your
husband &rsquo;ud better hisself, an&rsquo; earn better wage nor
what father gived en.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s worse off now it
seems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s terr&rsquo;ble bad off,&rdquo; agreed Alice
gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jobs be so scarce round our way.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; when Ned was out o&rsquo; work last spring along
o&rsquo; his accident, we got into debt.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the
interest to pay along wi&rsquo; everything else.&nbsp; We
couldn&rsquo;t afford to be too particular.&nbsp; Ned had to take
the first place he could get&mdash;&rsquo;tis but ten
shillin&rsquo; a week he&rsquo;s earnin&rsquo; now, along
o&rsquo; havin&rsquo; a house free, ye know.&nbsp; But ten
shillin&rsquo; a week&rsquo;s soon gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis, sure,&rdquo; agreed her mother
dolefully.</p>
<p>Alice looked up at the handsome, ruddy face now puckered with
sympathetic distress, and hesitated.</p>
<p>It is sometimes harder to ask a favour from our nearest and
dearest than from a stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder if you could
guess what&rsquo;s brought me this morning, mother?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>Mrs
Bolt did not commit herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned chanced to meet Jim Pike at Wimborne the other
day.&nbsp; He had to go and haul coal, you know, fro&rsquo; the
station.&nbsp; And Jim did tell en he were thinkin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; leavin&rsquo; father arter Christmas an&rsquo;
goin&rsquo; out abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees,&rdquo; said Mrs Bolt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jim be
a-goin&rsquo; to emmygrate, that&rsquo;s what he be a-goin&rsquo;
to do.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ve a had a letter from his brother what be
livin&rsquo; out yonder in America, and do want en to j&rsquo;ine
en out there.&nbsp; Jim be fair set on the notion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did tell Ned as father had rose his wage to fourteen
shillin&rsquo; a week.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis good wage that, an&rsquo;
there&rsquo;s the house too.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a deal more nor
what Ned be earnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said her mother, sinking her voice and
casting a scared glance at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You was
thinkin&rsquo; maybe father &rsquo;ud give your &rsquo;usband
Jim&rsquo;s place when he&rsquo;ve a-left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined Alice, instantly on the
defensive, &ldquo;it do seem hard as father should be
willin&rsquo; to pay away all that to a stranger when his own
flesh an&rsquo; blood is pretty nigh starvin&rsquo;.&nbsp; There!
mother, I do assure &rsquo;ee there&rsquo;s times when I wonder
where I&rsquo;m to get the next bit to put in little Abel&rsquo;s
mouth.&nbsp; Many a time I go hungry myself, an&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s not so very good for me nor for baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear heart alive!&rdquo; groaned Mrs Bolt, dropping
into the opposite chair and resting a hand on either knee.&nbsp;
&ldquo;God knows I&rsquo;m broken-hearted to think o&rsquo; your
bein&rsquo; in sich trouble&mdash;broken-hearted I be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little house o&rsquo; Jim Pike&rsquo;s &rsquo;ud
do us nicely,&rdquo; <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>went on Alice eagerly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a snug little place, an&rsquo; it &rsquo;ud be
nice to be near you, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would,&rdquo; agreed Mrs Bolt, sucking in her
breath, and exhaling it again with a deep sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
would jist about.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d love to have the childern
trottin&rsquo; in an&rsquo; out, an&rsquo; you an&rsquo; me could
help each other, Alice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could,&rdquo; agreed Alice, eyeing her mother with
pathetic anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But father be sich a terr&rsquo;ble one for
stickin&rsquo; to a notion,&rdquo; went on Mrs Bolt
gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ve reg&rsquo;lar took
again&rsquo; your &rsquo;usband, reg&rsquo;lar took again&rsquo;
him he have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tis a hard world,&rdquo; said Alice,
rising hurriedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d best go
home-along.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not mich use my bidin&rsquo;
here&mdash;but I did have hopes.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t as if
I was axin&rsquo; for a favour&mdash;I only want Ned to get the
chance father be willin&rsquo; to give any other man.&nbsp; But
we&rsquo;ll never have a chance here&mdash;I see that.&nbsp; I
wish to the Lard we could scrape up enough money to take us out
abroad too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be willin&rsquo; enough to emmygrate,
and so would Ned&mdash;nobody wants us here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Bolt gazed at her daughter meditatively, laying a
restraining hand upon her arm to prevent her departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim Pike&rsquo;s brother Robert, what emmygrated first,
went travellin&rsquo; by hissel&rsquo;,&rdquo; she
observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t take his wife an&rsquo;
childern wi&rsquo; en&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t afford the expense,
d&rsquo;ye see, but as soon as he were doin&rsquo; well he sent
for &rsquo;em to come an&rsquo; j&rsquo;ine him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Alice doubtfully, as she paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued her mother, &ldquo;there, sit ye
<a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>down, my
dear.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say all what&rsquo;s in my mind if I
think you&rsquo;m ready to rush off every minute.&nbsp; Sit down
an&rsquo; let&rsquo;s talk proper.&nbsp; Now see here, the notion
did come to I all at once while ye was talkin&rsquo; jist
now.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t Ned go out abroad wi&rsquo; Jim
Pike an&rsquo; look for work out in Ameriky?&nbsp; You could come
to us while ye was waitin&rsquo;&mdash;father &rsquo;ud be
pleased enough to have you an&rsquo; the childern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; exclaimed Alice indignantly.&nbsp; She
would have started from her chair again had not Mrs Bolt pinned
her to her seat with one large heavy hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t ye fly out like that, don&rsquo;t
ye,&rdquo; went on the good woman, impressively.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am but thinkin&rsquo; what&rsquo;s for the best.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;m our own flesh an&rsquo; blood, as ye say yourself,
an&rsquo; so&rsquo;s the childer; father&rsquo;d be fond enough
o&rsquo; the childer if he was to have &rsquo;em nigh en.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis but Ned as he&rsquo;ve a-took again&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but I bain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to desert
Ned,&rdquo; cried Alice, hotly.&nbsp; &ldquo;My own &rsquo;usband
what I&rsquo;ve a-chose and what have a-been sich a good
&rsquo;usband an&rsquo; sich a good father.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
he&rsquo;d work his fingers to the bwone for me an&rsquo; the
childern!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bide a bit, bide a bit,&rdquo; returned Mrs Bolt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a-piecin&rsquo; of it out in my
mind.&nbsp; If you an&rsquo; the little ones was once here,
ye&rsquo;d soon get round father&mdash;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low
he&rsquo;d never want to part from ye again.&nbsp; There, ye be
the only child what was spared to us.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t but
think so soon as there was talk o&rsquo; your j&rsquo;inin&rsquo;
Ned in Ameriky he&rsquo;d tell ye to send for him to come back
again, sooner nor let ye go.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Alice
was silent for a moment, struck in spite of herself, by the
idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
mid be a chance o&rsquo; that.&nbsp; Father used to be awful fond
o&rsquo; me when I was a little maid, an&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t
but see he noticed the childern to-day.&nbsp; He said Abel was a
jolly little chap.&nbsp; Abel was tryin&rsquo; to play cuckoo
wi&rsquo; his granfer.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s sich a friendly little
feller, I can&rsquo;t but think as father&rsquo;d soon take to
en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low he would,&rdquo; agreed Mrs Bolt,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for poor baby,&rdquo; went on her daughter, in an
aggrieved tone, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see no sich great likeness
to the Blanchards.&nbsp; Father will have it she takes after
Ned&rsquo;s mother&mdash;I can&rsquo;t see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; agreed the living grandmother, gravely,
considering the sleeping baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But still,&rdquo; went on Alice, suddenly reverting to
the main point from which she had been momentarily diverted by
the various side issues which seemed to present themselves,
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t let Ned go travellin&rsquo; all by
hisself.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t ever part wi&rsquo; en.&nbsp;
Summat mid happen as I mid never know.&nbsp; An&rsquo; he
midn&rsquo;t get on out there&mdash;an&rsquo; he midn&rsquo;t be
able to find the money to come home wi&rsquo; if father was to
let him come&mdash;Oh, mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This latter exclamation was uttered in a totally different
tone.&nbsp; She caught her breath with a gasp, her countenance
suddenly illuminated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to do?&rdquo; cried Mrs Bolt
eagerly.&nbsp; Little Abel, who had finished his apple, came
trotting across the room to share in the excitement.&nbsp; But he
was not destined to hear what was going on.&nbsp; Mrs Blanchard,
leaning forward in her chair, whispered <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>eagerly in
her mother&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; The latter&rsquo;s face, at first
astonished, grew gradually alarmed, but finally assumed an
expression of admiring delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what it mid
answer,&rdquo; she said slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
father&rsquo;d be overj&rsquo;yed to have you an&rsquo; the
childern here.&nbsp; But whatever &rsquo;ud your husband
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll manage Ned if you&rsquo;ll manage
father.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis worth tryin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Dear to be
sure, how happy we mid be all livin&rsquo; together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father &rsquo;ull be fit to kill us all if he do find
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t find out.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t be vexed
wi&rsquo; you anyhow.&nbsp; Ye need only say that I&rsquo;ve
a-told ye so, an&rsquo; axed ye to speak to en for I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; There, my dear,
I&rsquo;d be simply out o&rsquo; my wits wi&rsquo; joy.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve missed ye&mdash;there, I can&rsquo;t tell ye how much
I&rsquo;ve missed ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They clung together, half laughing, half weeping, and the
remainder of Alice&rsquo;s visit was spent in the congenial task
of building castles in the air.</p>
<p>Farmer Bolt was rather taciturn at dinner-time, and his wife
deemed it more prudent to postpone operations till a more
favourable moment.&nbsp; In the evening, however, when milking
was done, and tea over, and Mr Bolt drew up his chair to the fire
and filled his pipe, he himself gave her the opportunity for
which she had been hoping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye had Alice wi&rsquo; ye to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, she told me she&rsquo;d passed ye in the
Drove&mdash;how did ye think she was lookin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer smoked for a moment or two with a gloomy
expression.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ve fell away,&rdquo; he said at
last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fell away terr&rsquo;ble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She have,&rdquo; agreed his wife with a sigh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low &rsquo;tis a hard struggle for
she.&nbsp; There, she were a-tellin&rsquo; me she be often put to
it to find a bit to put in little Abel&rsquo;s mouth&mdash;them
was her very words.&nbsp; &lsquo;An&rsquo; I do often go hungry
myself,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;an&rsquo; it bain&rsquo;t so very
good for me or baby.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farmer Bolt removed his pipe and glowered fiercely at his
wife, as though she were responsible for this pitiable state of
affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what could she expect,&rdquo; he demanded,
&ldquo;when she took up wi&rsquo; that dalled chap?&nbsp; She
threw herself away on en&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t hear a word
again&rsquo; him, an&rsquo; he can&rsquo;t so much as keep
her.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the chap good for if he can&rsquo;t earn
enough to keep his wife an&rsquo; childer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good worker, ye know,&rdquo; said Mrs Bolt
tentatively; &ldquo;ye did never have no fault to find wi&rsquo;
en when he were wi&rsquo; us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find fault wi&rsquo; en now, though,&rdquo; shouted
her lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t he do summat?&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t he turn his hand to summat?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s all my
daughter have got to look to now.&nbsp; I says to her when she
took en, &lsquo;Alice,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;ye must choose
between Ned Blanchard an&rsquo; me.&rsquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo; she
chose Ned Blanchard.&nbsp; Well, let him do summat,
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be just a-thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; doin&rsquo;
summat, my dear,&rdquo; returned Mrs Bolt mildly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alice were tellin&rsquo; I to-day he were goin&rsquo; to
emmygrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the farmer aghast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He be goin&rsquo; out abroad&mdash;he be goin&rsquo; to
tole our Alice an&rsquo; them two little bits o&rsquo; childern
out across <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>the sea?&nbsp; Well, mother, how ye can sit
lookin&rsquo; at me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now, my dear, it bain&rsquo;t so bad as
that,&rdquo; said Mrs Bolt, in the same meek and ingratiating
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;He be a-goin&rsquo; to look for work,
that&rsquo;s what he be a-goin&rsquo; to do; an&rsquo; so soon as
he&rsquo;ve a-found it an&rsquo; have a-got a comfortable home
ready, then he&rsquo;ll send for our Alice an&rsquo; the childern
to j&rsquo;ine en.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the notion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said her husband, staring at her hard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the notion, be it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sucked at his pipe for a moment or two, still fixing his
unwinking gaze upon her; finally, he enquired in a stern and
disapproving tone what she supposed would become of their
daughter and her children in the meantime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said Mrs Bolt
gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis that what brought our Alice here
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer grunted without speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The journey to Ameriky &rsquo;ull take every single
shillin&rsquo; Ned Blanchard can scrape together,&rdquo; she
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be a-goin&rsquo; to send Alice an&rsquo; the
childern to the workhouse I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low,&rdquo; remarked
Mr Bolt, hitching his chair a little nearer to the hearth and
holding up one foot to the blaze.&nbsp; &ldquo;He be
a-goin&rsquo; to scuttle off wi&rsquo; hisself to Ameriky
an&rsquo; leave his wife an&rsquo; family on the
rates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now, nay now,&rdquo; protested Mrs Bolt in a
soothing tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d never be the one to allow
that, Bolt, you know you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; said Bolt, turning round with an expression
of great surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have I got to do wi&rsquo;
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&ldquo;Why, ye know very well, my dear, you&rsquo;d be
the last to let sich shame overtake your own flesh an&rsquo;
blood.&nbsp; If Ned was once away, you wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo;
no objections to your own daughter a-comin&rsquo; back here for a
while, an&rsquo; your own grandchildern, would ye?&nbsp;
They&rsquo;d bring a bit o&rsquo; life about this place,
an&rsquo; it &rsquo;ud be nice to have our Alice goin&rsquo;
about the house again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence; Mr Bolt stirred up the contents of his
pipe with the end of a match and lit it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Abel be wonderful like his mother in his
ways,&rdquo; went on Mrs Bolt; &ldquo;the very moral o&rsquo;
what she used to be at his age.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s her little
chair in the corner, look-see.&nbsp; He found it out to-day
an&rsquo; fetched it over aside o&rsquo; your chair, an&rsquo;
sat hisself down in it&mdash;there, I declare for a minute I
thought our Alice was a child again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Bolt squinted round at the chair, but did not commit
himself by speech.&nbsp; He was not an imaginative man,
nevertheless the vision rose before him of the curly-headed child
who used to sit in that chair, and whom he had loved as the apple
of his eye.&nbsp; His wife put his thoughts into words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye mind our Alice, how pleased she used to be when ye
called her over of an evening?&nbsp; Dear to be sure, what a
bonny little maid she was, and what a pride we used to take in
her.&nbsp; And now to think that poor creetur&rsquo; what come
here to-day is her.&nbsp; There, I could ha&rsquo; cried to see
her in that wold patched dress&mdash;&rsquo;ees, an&rsquo; I did
cry when she did tell I how she do often go hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m dalled if she shall go hungry while she
<a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>bides
wi&rsquo; us,&rdquo; cried the farmer, sitting suddenly upright
in his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let Master Ned emmygrate so soon as he
pleases, an&rsquo; let the poor maid come to us&mdash;an&rsquo;
the brats too.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll know what &rsquo;tis for a
while, to eat wi&rsquo;out stintin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Let her come
an&rsquo; bide so long as she likes&mdash;the longer the better,
say I&mdash;the longer she&rsquo;s shut o&rsquo; that
n&rsquo;er-do-weel o&rsquo; a husband the better pleased
I&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following week Alice and her children took up their abode
at her old home.&nbsp; Alice was pale and nervous at first, but
soon regained her self-possession.&nbsp; The farmer was almost
boisterous in his welcome.</p>
<p>After tea Mrs Bolt, with a wink at her daughter, installed the
little boy in the chair before referred to, at his
grandfather&rsquo;s side, an arrangement in which the latter
acquiesced silently, yet with evident pleasure.&nbsp; Abel
watched him with round inquisitive eyes while he filled and lit
his pipe, and leaning back in his chair, crossed his legs
luxuriously.&nbsp; Presently, possessing himself of a bit of
stick which lay beside the hearth, the child wedged it in a
corner of his own small mouth, and trotting back to his chair,
settled himself in it, in as close an imitation of his
grandfather&rsquo;s attitude as the differences of age and size,
and a slight difficulty in distinguishing his right leg from his
left, would admit of.&nbsp; Abel the elder stared for a moment,
and then, realising the state of affairs, nudged his wife with a
delighted chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He be a
sharp little chap if ever there was one.&nbsp; Ye shall have a
better pipe nor that to smoke, sonny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer was as good as his word, and on the <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>next day
purchased a supply of sugar-sticks, one of which he gravely
handed to his grandson every evening before lighting his own
pipe.</p>
<p>Whether it was because the little fellow was won over by this
practical proof of consideration and regard, or whether the
affinity which the women-folk were so fond of talking about,
really existed, it is certain that before the Blanchard family
were a week in the house, the two Abels were practically
inseparable.&nbsp; Whether toddling along a furrow in his
grandfather&rsquo;s wake, or riding one of the farm horses, or
perched on top of a pile of mangolds, the child was his
grandfather&rsquo;s constant companion.</p>
<p>Alice almost insensibly fell back into the ways of her
girlhood, and, as the days passed, her youth itself seemed to
return to her.&nbsp; She grew plump and rosy, sang as she went
about her work, played with her little ones as though she were a
child herself.&nbsp; Had it not been for the presence of the
children, indeed, Mrs Bolt often declared she could have fancied
old times were back again, and their maid had never left
them.&nbsp; The good food, the freedom from petty anxieties, had
no doubt much to do with this happy change, but it was chiefly
brought about by the new hope in her heart which grew and
brightened day by day.</p>
<p>One morning, however, Mr Bolt, coming back unexpectedly from
the field where he had been ploughing, and happening to take a
short-cut through the orchard, came upon Alice who was hanging
out clothes to dry.&nbsp; Now it was Mrs Bolt&rsquo;s custom to
let the world know that she had been washing, by setting the
linen to dry in front of the house; the <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>larger
articles being draped on clothes-lines that ran from the corner
of the milk-house wall to the post by the wood-shed, while the
smaller were neatly spread upon the hedge.&nbsp; But here was
Alice setting up a private clothes-line of her own, and hanging
garments on it&mdash;not her own, or her children&rsquo;s
garments, as her father first supposed, but socks and shirts,
even a pair of nankeen trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mid ye be doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo; he enquired, at
the top of his voice, and so suddenly that poor Alice dropped her
basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, to be sure, father, how you frightened me!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, stammering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gave ye leave to make a dryin&rsquo;-ground
o&rsquo; my archard?&rdquo; resumed the farmer, striding up to
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;These here apple-trees wasn&rsquo;t made to
hang clothes on.&nbsp; Whose clothes be these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the pretty bloom fled from Alice&rsquo;s face; for a
moment she stood gaping, unable to find an answer; then all at
once she laughed&mdash;or tried to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what a to-do,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whose
clothes be they?&nbsp; Well, they be man&rsquo;s clothes, as ye
can see&mdash;an&rsquo; you be the only man about this here
place, bain&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ominous pause ensued, during which Farmer Bolt, turning to
the clothes-line, closely examined the garments thereon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be sorry to wear that shirt,&rdquo; he
remarked; &ldquo;and when did ye ever see me in trousers like
them?&nbsp; They&rsquo;m your
&rsquo;usband&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s what they be; an&rsquo;
what be tellin&rsquo; lies about &rsquo;em for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice, who had always been known as a &ldquo;spiritty
maid,&rdquo; fired up at this.</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>&ldquo;I think it &rsquo;ud be a queer thing if I was
to name my husband to ye,&rdquo; she responded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye
can never find a good word to say for him.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
natural enough for me to be unwillin&rsquo; to let his name pass
my lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be doin&rsquo; washin&rsquo; his clothes?&nbsp; I
thought he&rsquo;d emmygrated?&rdquo; pursued the father
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are his clothes, then,&rdquo; said Alice, with
flashing eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, they are his clothes;
I&rsquo;ll not deny it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a-washed &rsquo;em in
the water what the Lard gave us all free, an&rsquo; I be
a-dryin&rsquo; of &rsquo;em in the air what belongs so much to
him as to you, father.&nbsp; An&rsquo; this here bit o&rsquo;
rope&rsquo;s what was tied round my own box, so I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low he bain&rsquo;t beholden to ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Bolt, slightly abashed, moved a few steps away, and then
paused again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be ye a-goin&rsquo; to send his washin&rsquo; out to
Ameriky to en every week?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>His daughter made no answer, and Mr Bolt was obliged to go
indoors to seek for further information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did Ned Blanchard emmygrate,&rdquo; he enquired
abruptly entering the kitchen.</p>
<p>Mrs Bolt was stooping over the fire, and it was perhaps on
this account that her face became so red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thursday was a fortnight, warn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she
enquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, Thursday was a fartnight he
shifted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Farmer Bolt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them ships
which goes back&rsquo;ards and for&rsquo;ards to Ameriky must
travel martal fast.&nbsp; Our Alice be a-hangin&rsquo; up his
clothes to dry in the archard now.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>&ldquo;There, don&rsquo;t talk sich nonsence,
Bolt!&rdquo; cried his wife sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;She be but
a-washin&rsquo; a few o&rsquo; the things what he left behind,
o&rsquo; course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, be it?&rdquo; said Mr Bolt with a keen
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs Bolt, making a
great rattle with the poker between the bars of the grate.&nbsp;
Mr Bolt eyed her for a moment or two in silence, and then went
slowly out again, jamming his hat firmly on his head.&nbsp;
Several times that day his wife and daughter encountered his
fixed gaze, but he asked no further questions.</p>
<p>On the following day, chancing to look backwards at his snug
house in the hollow, from the uplands where he was at work, he
observed a white streamer dangling from his own gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve tied a towel to the gate,&rdquo; he
murmured to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;What can they be wantin&rsquo;
carrier to call for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For by this simple expedient the carrier, journeying on the
high road above, became aware of the fact that the dwellers in
the lane needed his services.&nbsp; Farmer Bolt went on wondering
all the way up that furrow and all the way down again, and
presently caught sight of the carrier&rsquo;s van turning down
the lane.&nbsp; He continued to speculate while the green-hooded
vehicle turned into his own yard, emerged again, and finally came
crawling up the stony incline to the high road.&nbsp; Then Farmer
Bolt, unable any longer to restrain his curiosity, brought his
horses to a standstill, and leaving them to their own devices,
hastened across the field to the corner which the van must
pass.</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>&ldquo;That parcel what my wife gived ye just now,
Jan,&rdquo; he panted, as he approached;&nbsp; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
have a look at it.&nbsp; I want to make sure it&rsquo;s addressed
right.&nbsp; My wold &rsquo;ooman bain&rsquo;t no great hand with
the pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas your daughter wrote the address,&rdquo;
returned the carrier.&nbsp; &ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low
it&rsquo;ll be right enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He produced the parcel, nevertheless, and the farmer hastily
examined it.&nbsp; The address was certainly set forth in a
clear, legible hand:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Mr <span class="smcap">Edward
Blanchard</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c/o The Black
Inn,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sturminster.</p>
<p>To be left till called for.</p>
<p>He spelt it out slowly, thrusting out his underlip the while,
with a puzzled look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be left till called for,&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It do seem a queer thing that.&nbsp; How be the man
a-goin&rsquo; to call for it when he&rsquo;ve emmygrated to
Ameriky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, and &rsquo;ave &rsquo;ee?&rdquo; enquired the
carrier, much interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, a fartnight ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tis funny too; but I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I
must obey arders.&nbsp; Hand over that parcel, farmer.&nbsp; I
did ought to be gettin&rsquo; on; we&rsquo;m a bit late as it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Bolt handed him the parcel, and the carrier whipped up his
horse; but the van had hardly rattled on a few yards before its
driver was again hailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! bide a bit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the carrier, turning.</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Mr
Bolt came alongside, red and breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye mid just ask the folks at the Black who they expects
to call for that there parcel,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be
a bit puzzled in my mind about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; agreed the other; &ldquo;but let me go
now, good man, else I&rsquo;ll never get to Sturminster to ask
about no parcels at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Bolt was in a stern and silent mood during the whole of
that day, and after tea, instead of settling down to his pipe
with little Abel in his chair beside him, strolled out Branston
way to meet the carrier.&nbsp; He had not long to wait before he
heard the familiar creaking and rattling of the rickety van, and
presently the solitary light of its swinging lantern came bobbing
along between the hedges.&nbsp; The farmer repeated the procedure
of the morning:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, bide a bit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, be it you, Mr Bolt?&nbsp; Ah, I axed that there
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ye?&rdquo; said the farmer, planting himself in
front of the horse on the wet roadway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low there&rsquo;s some
mistake about Ed&rsquo;ard Blanchard emmygrating.&nbsp; He be to
call for that parcel hisself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be he?&rdquo; enquired Mr Bolt with starting eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be.&nbsp; There was never no talk of his
emmygrating, the folks at the Black d&rsquo; say.&nbsp; He be
a-workin&rsquo; under the same measter, an&rsquo; a-drivin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; the same cart.&nbsp; He have shifted from the house he
had to a lodging i&rsquo; the town, but that&rsquo;s all the
emmygration he did do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;Thank
&rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a funny thing as ye didn&rsquo;t
know, warn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; remarked the carrier as he gathered
up the reins.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blanchard&rsquo;s your
daughter&rsquo;s husband, bain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Bolt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low it be a funny thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
turned away, and the van jingled past him and soon disappeared
into the darkness.&nbsp; Mr Bolt went slowly homewards, revolving
this astonishing discovery in his mind.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d been
tricked&mdash;that was what had happened.&nbsp; They were all in
it, Ned and Alice, and even his wife.&nbsp; They thought they
could fool him just as if he were a child.&nbsp; He knew what
they were at.&nbsp; They thought that once Alice and her children
were established at the farm he could never find it in his heart
to turn them out again; but he would soon show them whether he
could or not.&nbsp; No doubt Master Ned intended to come marching
in by and by, expecting to be received with open arms.&nbsp; They
thought him, Farmer Bolt, a regular sammy, did they?&nbsp;
He&rsquo;d let them know what sort of a sammy he was!&nbsp;
Perhaps he could make fools of them just as easily as they had
made a fool of him.&nbsp; He stood stock-still in the road all at
once&mdash;an idea had flashed across him, a scheme of vengeance
quite as subtle as the offence, and moreover appropriate.&nbsp;
They&mdash;those deceivers&mdash;should find themselves caught in
their own trap!</p>
<p>He strode on now and presently burst impetuously into the
family living-room.&nbsp; Alice and his wife were sitting on
either side of the fire; little Abel had fallen fast asleep in
his tiny chair, his curly head drooping at a most uncomfortable
angle <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>over the arm.&nbsp; The farmer stopped abruptly at
sight of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that child doing here at this time
o&rsquo; the evening?&rdquo; he enquired, roughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did beg so hard to sit up till granfer come
back,&rdquo; explained Mrs Bolt, &ldquo;we had to let en
bide.&nbsp; There, nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;ud satisfy him.&nbsp; I
give him his sugar-stick, but that wouldn&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; He
said he must stop up an&rsquo; smoke his pipe wi&rsquo;
granfer.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been a-savin&rsquo; it till ye
come&mdash;there&rsquo;s but just the leastest little corner bit
off, look-see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But granfer did not look.&nbsp; He sat heavily down in his
chair and glared at Alice, who was knitting a woollen
comforter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he enquired, savagely.</p>
<p>She glanced up with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t
look,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Christmas
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye be a-goin&rsquo; to send it out to Ned in Ameriky, I
suppose,&rdquo; he suggested sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for Ned,&rdquo; returned Alice quickly,
and Mrs Bolt added in a reproachful tone:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor maid be a-makin&rsquo; it for you,
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, during which the farmer recalled his injury
and resolved not to be mollified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas,&rdquo; he said slowly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Christmas.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low Ned &rsquo;ull feel
hisself a bit lonely spendin&rsquo; Christmas in Ameriky.&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;d best write an&rsquo; tell en to come back an&rsquo;
spend it wi&rsquo; us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the scheme which the farmer had elaborated during his
ireful descent of the lane.&nbsp; He would tell Alice to send for
her husband, and she, carrying out her former plan of action,
would <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>pretend to write to America and invite him to return,
but as soon as Ned appeared he would find he had met his
match.&nbsp; Farmer Bolt would desire him and his family to
emmygrate out o&rsquo; that house, and never set foot in it
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll surprise &rsquo;em all a bit, I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low,&rdquo; said Mr Bolt vengefully to himself.</p>
<p>He did not look at Alice as he spoke, half fearful of
prematurely betraying his anger; but after a moment, finding she
did not reply, he wheeled in his chair with an enquiring
glance.</p>
<p>Alice had dropped her work on her lap and was leaning forward,
gazing at him with eyes that were full of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked impatiently.&nbsp; Before he
realised what she was about she had risen from her chair and
thrown her arms round his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, father,
I can&rsquo;t bear it!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re so good&mdash;so good
to me, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been that wicked and
deceitful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she uttered the last word, the farmer, who at first had
struggled to free himself, became suddenly passive in her
embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, I have,&rdquo; she went on, sobbing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, mother, I be a-goin&rsquo; to tell en
everything.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t go on actin&rsquo; lies when
he be so kind.&nbsp; Oh, father, I&rsquo;ve deceived ye
shameful.&nbsp; Ned isn&rsquo;t in Ameriky at all&mdash;he never
emmygrated.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas jist a made-up story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shaking with sobs she clung closer to her father, who still
sat immovable and looking straight before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder ye can scarce believe it,&rdquo;
she <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>wept.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could never ha&rsquo; believed it
o&rsquo; myself, but we was so wretched, Ned an&rsquo; me,
an&rsquo; so terr&rsquo;ble bad off, an&rsquo; I thought if ye
once had me back i&rsquo; my wold place ye&rsquo;d maybe get fond
o&rsquo; me again&mdash;ye used to be so fond o&rsquo; me,
father.&nbsp; I thought ye&rsquo;d maybe take to the
childern&mdash;an&rsquo; that by-and-by ye&rsquo;d maybe forgive
Ned, an&rsquo; gie en the carter&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr Bolt, &ldquo;that was it, was
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye know &rsquo;twould be only nat&rsquo;ral, my
dear,&rdquo; put in Mrs Bolt meekly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye
wouldn&rsquo;t be out o&rsquo; pocket by it, an&rsquo; ye&rsquo;d
be pervidin&rsquo; for your own flesh an&rsquo; blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Bolt&rsquo;s countenance changed; his wife&rsquo;s
suggestion was eminently practical, and he could not help being
struck by it.&nbsp; Nevertheless the share she had taken in the
recent plot was still too fresh in his memory to admit of his
parleying with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, wold &rsquo;ooman,&rdquo; he cried, screwing
himself round in his chair, &ldquo;ye needn&rsquo;t be
a-puttin&rsquo; your oar in.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;d better keep
quiet.&nbsp; I wonder ye dare look me in the face,&rdquo; he
added sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t mother&rsquo;s
fault&mdash;&rsquo;twas me thought of it,&rdquo; cried Alice
quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas me planfned
it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; &rsquo;twas very well planned too,&rdquo;
commented her father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only wonder ye should
ha&rsquo; thought I&rsquo;d ever change my mind.&nbsp; Ye do know
I be a man o&rsquo; my word, don&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, I do,&rdquo; sobbed she, &ldquo;but
still&mdash;oh dear, father, haven&rsquo;t we been happy together
these last few weeks, and haven&rsquo;t ye got fond o&rsquo;
little Abel, an&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice for us all to be
friends?&nbsp; Ye <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>did use to say Ned was a terr&rsquo;ble good
worker,&rdquo; she added wistfully.</p>
<p>Mr Bolt looked at first severe and then dubious; this was
evidently an aspect of the case which had not before presented
itself.&nbsp; The rigidity of his form relaxed in some degree,
and for the first time since Alice&rsquo;s confession he cast on
her a glance which, though reproachful, was not unfriendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true, that,&rdquo; he said in a meditative
tone, &ldquo;&rsquo;ees, &rsquo;tis true.&nbsp; Ye be a
truth-tellin&rsquo; maid as a rule, my dear.&nbsp; I wonder how
you came to make up such a lyin&rsquo; tale about the
emmygration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Alice hid her face he continued more kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, we&rsquo;ll say no more about that since ye
owned up at the last.&nbsp; I mid own up about summat too, as
maybe ye wouldn&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice raised her head quickly, and Mrs Bolt dropped the poker,
and turned round.&nbsp; Little Abel, disturbed by the clatter,
moved uneasily in his sleep.&nbsp; The farmer looked from the
women&rsquo;s scared faces to that of the child, and all at once
smoothed the waving hair from his daughter&rsquo;s forehead and
kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I will, though,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, some things is best forgot.&nbsp; I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I&rsquo;ll forget this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll forgive as well as forget?&rdquo;
said Alice.&nbsp; Mr Bolt disengaged himself gently, rose, and
took a hurried turn about the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bain&rsquo;t one what likes to go again&rsquo; my
word,&rdquo; he said after a moment&rsquo;s hard thinking.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d never let your husband cross my
door&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Both the anxious women exclaimed <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>simultaneously; the farmer threw out his hand to
command silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bide a bit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll work out
all right.&nbsp; When I said that about your husband, Alice, I
didn&rsquo;t know he were going to be my carter.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s a different story, bain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what my carter mid have to come in and
out of the house for arders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Alice went quickly towards him, her eyes shining and her
bosom heaving, he burst into a roar of laughter; and then,
becoming suddenly serious, caught her in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, write to your husband, love,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Write to en so soon as ye like.&nbsp; Tell
him&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, and then began to laugh again, but
unsteadily, &ldquo;tell him he can emmygrate back again,
an&rsquo; while he be waitin&rsquo; for Jim to give up the
carter&rsquo;s place, we&rsquo;ll make shift to spend a merry
Christmas together.&rdquo;</p>

150</span>FARMER BARNES&rsquo; DILEMMA</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Farmer Barnes</span> stirred his tea
vigorously and continuously for some minutes, raised the cup to
his lips, with the spoon still in it, paused, tasted again,
glancing severely over the edge at his daughter Maimie, and then
remarked, in somewhat stern tones:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t put no brandy in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, feyther; I clean forgot to tell ye as there was
scarce a drop left in bottle yesterday.&nbsp; I put the little
drain that was left in tea-pot, but I&rsquo;m afeared there
weren&rsquo;t enough to make mich difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tay bain&rsquo;t drawed at all, lass&mdash;it makes
all that difference.&nbsp; Ye should ha&rsquo; towd me when I was
goin&rsquo; to town yesterday as bottle were nigh
empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that I should; but I forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Maimie wrinkled up her forehead until her eyebrows nearly
touched her fair fluffy fringe.&nbsp; Her father set down his cup
with a kind of groan, and looked at her with eyes that seemed
puzzled, well nigh tearful, in spite of their severity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yigh, you&rsquo;re a good hand at forgettin&rsquo;,
Maimie&mdash;ye met tak&rsquo; a prize for&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There
weren&rsquo;t a bit o&rsquo; sauce wi&rsquo; the cowd pork
to-day, and the taters was as hard as hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maimie coloured and looked down; the farmer gazed at her
sternly for a full minute, and then made <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>a sudden
lunge at the youngest child who sat next to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong wi&rsquo; thy bishop, Maggie?&nbsp;
One side is all tucked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tore,&rdquo; announced Maggie, with a
certain triumph in a statement which must call down condemnation
on her elder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our Maimie said as she&rsquo;d mend
it&mdash;she&rsquo;ve been sayin&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll mend it all
the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;rt a nasty little tell-tale, Maggie,&rdquo;
cried Maimie with some heat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye never think for to
remind me wi&rsquo;out it&rsquo;s jest at my busiest
time&mdash;when I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; dinner ready or
summat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, never mind,&rdquo; interposed Barnes
gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis allus the same story.&nbsp;
Young heads I suppose is what we mun look for on young
shoulders.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he went on with his tea, swallowing
it in great gulps, and as it were under protest, and remarking
every now and then below his breath that it wasn&rsquo;t half
drawed.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the meal the younger children slid down
from their seats, and began to play noisily in a corner, while
Maimie &ldquo;sided&rdquo; the things.&nbsp; Her father pushed
back his chair, with a squeaking sound, over the tiled floor, lit
his pipe, and, extending his stocking-clad feet to the blaze,
smoked meditatively and despondently.</p>
<p>Maimie glanced at him every now and then as she went backwards
and forwards between kitchen and buttery, and at last, pausing
opposite to him, encountered his steadfast and sombre gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come thou here, my lass,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;put
down yon dish, and come and sit here aside o&rsquo; me.&nbsp; <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>Maimie,&rdquo; he continued solemnly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; summat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maimie, impressed by his tone, gazed at him with scared blue
eyes, not caring to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo;
summat,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;summat rather
partik&rsquo;ler.&nbsp; First off I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo;
a dale about your mother, Maimie.&nbsp; I miss her
dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure ye do, feyther,&rdquo; said the girl
with a sob.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis what we all do.&nbsp; Nobry
can&rsquo;t miss poor mother more nor me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a twelvemonth or more since she was
took,&rdquo; continued Barnes, in the same sepulchral tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, a twelvemonth &rsquo;twas last Sunday week&mdash;and
the house don&rsquo;t seem like itself at all.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t say but what you do your best, my lass, but things
seem to be warsening every day.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whatever
mother &rsquo;ud say if she were here to see it&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m fair moidered
wi&rsquo; nobbut thinkin&rsquo; on it.&nbsp; It seems same as if
I wasn&rsquo;t doin&rsquo; my dooty by her, poor soul.&nbsp; She
was allus that house-proud for one thing, and sich a
manager.&nbsp; Summat &rsquo;ull ha&rsquo; to be done,
Maimie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maimie began to whimper, and to wipe her eyes with her apron,
and to protest in muffled tones from behind its folds that she
did try, and she couldn&rsquo;t tell how &rsquo;twas as things
always seemed to slip her memory.&nbsp; The children was tiresome
for one thing, and tore their clothes much more than when mother
was alive, and they didn&rsquo;t mind her a bit, and she had
meant to make some apple-sauce, and, and&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; interrupted Barnes,
leaning forward with one great hand on either knee, <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;rt but young, as I say, and I
mustn&rsquo;t expect too much fro&rsquo; thee.&nbsp; Do what ye
will ye can&rsquo;t be like poor mother; nay, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t
to be looked for; nay, it &rsquo;ud want sombry else as is older
and wiser nor thee, lass, to take mother&rsquo;s place.&nbsp; Ah,
I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that&rdquo;&mdash;here he
paused, slowly polishing the knees of his corduroys with his
broad palms,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wishful for to do my dooty by
your poor mother, my dear,&rdquo; he resumed presently, looking
very hard at Maimie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, I couldn&rsquo;t noways
rest easy in my mind, if I didn&rsquo;t strive to do that, and
so, as I tell ye, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo;
summat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are ye thinkin&rsquo; on, feyther?&rdquo; cried
the girl quickly.</p>
<p>Mr Barnes restored his pipe to his mouth, sucked at it, and
then, blowing out a cloud of smoke, looked at his daughter with
moist eyes from amid the blue mist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill go hard wi&rsquo; me,&rdquo; he said
slowly; &ldquo;it will indeed, but the question isn&rsquo;t what
I&rsquo;d choose, but what she&rsquo;d choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; cried Maimie, quite at sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the poor missus, your mother.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll go
agen me, as I say, but I&rsquo;ve made up my mind for to do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, feyther, speak plain.&nbsp; To
do what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to take a second, my dear,&rdquo; said the farmer,
speaking somewhat indistinctly by reason of the pipe which was
still firmly wedged in the corner of his mouth, but with the same
solemn dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;To get wed&mdash;to pick soombry out
as &rsquo;ud do for me the way your dear mother done for <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>me&mdash;one as &rsquo;ud keep things straight, same as
they used to be, and have an eye to all of you young
folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but, feyther, mother &rsquo;ud never ha&rsquo;
liked that,&rdquo; protested Maimie.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the
very last thing she&rsquo;d wish, to have a stranger put in her
place, and a stepmother cocked up over her childer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cocked up,&rdquo; repeated the farmer sternly,
&ldquo;the one as I have in my mind isn&rsquo;t like to be easy
cocked up.&nbsp; A sensible, steady, hard-workin&rsquo;
woman&mdash;a widder too, so ye may think she&rsquo;ll have a
feelin&rsquo; heart for me.&nbsp; And one as have childer of her
own, a plenty of &rsquo;em, and &rsquo;ull know how to dale
wi&rsquo; all on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it, feyther?&rdquo; gasped the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs Wharton o&rsquo; the Pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Wharton!&rdquo; ejaculated Maimie.&nbsp; She
checked the tears which were ready to fall, and sat looking at
her father in amazement, the colour sweeping over her pretty
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;ve got six childer of her own,
and pretty nigh all of &rsquo;em lads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father nodded sideways with a contented air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll come in handy about the place I
dare-say,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she only buried Mr Wharton six month
ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I reckon she&rsquo;ll feel the want of
him&mdash;very nigh as bad as I feel the want o&rsquo; your
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;d never think o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; wed
again&mdash;she&rsquo;s fifty-five and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barnes removed his pipe, pointing with the stem at Maimie to
enforce the comparison:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>&ldquo;Your mother,&rdquo; he said brokenly,
&ldquo;your mother, my dear, was fifty-four and a
bit&mdash;&rsquo;tis a nice age.&nbsp; The more I think
on&rsquo;t, the more I do seem to tak&rsquo; to the notion.&nbsp;
Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what you&rsquo;ll do, Maimie&mdash;jest
pop round to-morrow and ax Mrs Wharton to come and eat her Sunday
dinner wi&rsquo; us&mdash;her and all her fam&rsquo;ly.&nbsp;
Sunday is a good day for doin&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo;
coortin&rsquo;&mdash;her and me &rsquo;ull mak&rsquo; it up while
you youngsters are making merry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but, feyther&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but, I&rsquo;ll not ha&rsquo; no buts,&rdquo;
shouted her father, good-humouredly but firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
what I tell thee, my lass.&nbsp; My mind&rsquo;s made up, so thou
met as well put the best face thou can on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When feyther hammered on the table after that imperative
fashion, and threw so much determination into his one-sided nod,
Maimie knew from experience that it was useless to argue, and,
with a heavy heart, promised to obey.</p>
<p>Sunday came and proved to be all that Sunday ought to be:
sunshiny and bright.</p>
<p>After church the Whartons and Barnes&rsquo; came trooping down
the flagged path together: Jim brave in the flowered waistcoat
which had been laid aside since the death of his missus, and the
Widow Wharton displaying a white flower in her bonnet, and
discarding her crape &ldquo;weeper.&rdquo;&nbsp; As they
proceeded in single file, both being too portly in figure to walk
side by side, the neighbours smiled and winked, and nudged each
other, and remarked that it was a match for sure.&nbsp; The
children of both families, stiff and prim in their best clothes,
eyed each other somewhat shyly, but presently <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>fraternised; though Luke, the eldest Wharton lad, a
fine, well-grown young fellow already in the twenties, walked
apart, silently, and with a gloomy face.</p>
<p>Maimie had stayed at home, busy over hospitable preparations,
and now, with a flushed face and a heavy heart, stood awaiting
her visitors.&nbsp; She revived a little presently, when Mrs
Wharton praised her cooking, and remarked that she could not have
made the pudden better herself; but her countenance soon clouded
over again.&nbsp; During the meal feyther paid marked attention
to the lady of his choice, filling up her glass until she was
obliged to protect it by keeping one broad hand outspread on the
top, piling her plate with beef, and leering in an amorous
fashion whenever he caught her eye; and, at its conclusion, he
requested Mrs Wharton to withdraw with him to the parlour, and
jocularly told the young folk they might clear away and cut what
capers they liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out for a smoke, I think,&rdquo; said
Luke; but he spoke somewhat hesitatingly, and looked
questioningly at Maimie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Without,&rdquo; he added
gallantly, &ldquo;I can be of any service to you, Miss
Barnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do just what you please,&rdquo; she returned
shortly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you feel more like
making merry nor I do mysel&rsquo;.&nbsp; The childer can play if
they&rsquo;ve a mind to; but it &rsquo;ull take me all my time to
clear away&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve no great fancy for making merry
as how &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll help ye with the tray,&rdquo; said
Luke.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, little &rsquo;uns, ye can take hands
round and start &lsquo;The Mulberry Bush.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twill keep &rsquo;em quiet.&nbsp; <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>I
can&rsquo;t but feel sorry for ye, Maimie,&rdquo; he continued,
as he took hold of the tray.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
what none of us &rsquo;ud like, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; and he
jerked his head towards the closed door of the parlour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye think your mother &rsquo;ull have him then?&rdquo;
said Maimie, with a sinking heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out one way nor t&rsquo;other.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s got no call to be thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; wedlock,
mother hasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Feyther have left her every stick on
the place.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a nice place, as ye know, Maimie, and
she&rsquo;s reet well off.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help but
ha&rsquo; words wi&rsquo; her last night, and she answered me
back awful sharp.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis time there was a
change, Mester Luke,&rsquo; says she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou&rsquo;rt
gettin&rsquo; above thyself, lad,&rsquo; she says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what do the younger ones say to it?&rdquo;
said Maimie, pausing in the act of setting a pile of plates on
the tray which he held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, they don&rsquo;t say much.&nbsp; Mother can do what
she likes wi&rsquo; they.&nbsp; They look a bit glum, but
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t much use lookin&rsquo; glum, I
reckon,&rdquo; sighed the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Feyther&rsquo;s that
set on the notion he won&rsquo;t hear naught agen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dessay,&rdquo; said Luke; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a very
good match for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit better nor &rsquo;tis for your mother,&rdquo;
cried Maimie, tossing her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, our place is twice as big as this,&rdquo; returned
the youth; &ldquo;and mother have money put by&mdash;a dale of
brass she have.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t fancy your feyther could
match it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were slowly proceeding towards the buttery <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>by this
time, each holding on to an end of the tray; through the open
doorway the children could be seen dancing round and round, while
they vociferated shrilly the time-honoured refrain
&ldquo;Ring-a-ring-a-roses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to match your mother&rsquo;s
brass, nor yet your mother,&rdquo; said Maimie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wish she and the lot o&rsquo; you had kep&rsquo; away&mdash;that
I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s all ye can find to say to me,
I&rsquo;d best take myself off,&rdquo; cried Luke angrily, and he
suddenly let go of his end of the tray.</p>
<p>There was a slide, a clatter, a crash; the piled up crockery,
too heavy for Maimie&rsquo;s arms alone, had slipped to the end
of the tilted tray and fallen on the tiled buttery floor.</p>
<p>Maimie glanced at the heap of destruction for one moment, and
then burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go for to do it,&rdquo; shouted Luke,
overwhelmed with horror and remorse.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought
ye&rsquo;d firm howd on tray, Maimie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh dear, eh dear,&rdquo; sobbed Maimie, the tears
pouring through her outspread fingers, her bosom heaving
convulsively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatever mun I do?&nbsp;
Feyther&rsquo;ll be mad.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll be that shamed
before your mother and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke struck at his forehead vengefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a regular fool,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a downright wastral and good-for-naught,
that&rsquo;s what I am.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t forgive myself for
being so rough.&nbsp; Dunnot take agen me, Maimie, dunnot!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m right down sorry&mdash;awful sorry, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;belive&mdash;you are,&rdquo;
sobbed Maimie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear I am,&rdquo; asserted Luke, and,
picking his <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>way through the fragments of crockery, he put his arm
round Maimie&rsquo;s waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe you are,&rdquo; she said, relenting a
little, but still weeping piteously.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a
judgment on me I&rsquo;m sure; I didn&rsquo;t ought to ha&rsquo;
spoke that way about your mother to your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, if it comes to that,&rdquo; groaned Luke,
penitently, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ought to ha&rsquo; cast up
about the brass to ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time he was mopping delicately at Maimie&rsquo;s eyes
with a beautiful silk handkerchief, duly perfumed with a bottle
of sixpenny scent; and Maimie was so touched by this attention
that she presently smiled wanly through her tears, and the two
concluded a compact of friendship as they cleared away the broken
china.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jim Barnes and Mrs Wharton sat face to face on
either side of the parlour fire, gazing at each other for some
time in unbroken silence.&nbsp; Presently the farmer spoke,
pointing at the widow with his thumb, and inaugurating
proceedings by heaving a deep sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon ye miss the gaffer, Mrs Wharton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do indeed, Mr Barnes,&rdquo; returned the widow, with
an answering sigh, which made her stiff black silk creak
alarmingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;ye can&rsquo;t miss him more nor what I do my
poor missus.&nbsp; She was a wonderful woman, Mrs
Wharton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was&mdash;ah, she was.&nbsp; Providence seems to
ha&rsquo; dealt a bit &rsquo;ard wi&rsquo; the two of us, Mr
Barnes, but we munnot <i>re</i>-pine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this there came a pause, during which <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>the farmer
scratched his head and rubbed his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lass, Maimie, d&rsquo;ye see&mdash;she&rsquo;s a
very good lass, but a bit giddy&mdash;she dunnot seem never to
remember naught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s but young,&rdquo; said the widow
tolerantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our Luke&mdash;the eldest lad, he do
seem to gi&rsquo; me a lot o&rsquo; trouble.&nbsp; Wants to know
better nor me, and is ever and always trying to be gaffer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Women don&rsquo;t know naught about farmin&rsquo;,&rsquo;
says he to me as bold as ye please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; ejaculated Jim, with a deeply
scandalised air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not but what,&rdquo; continued the widow,
half-laughingly, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection; &ldquo;not
but what the lad have got a wonderful notion o&rsquo; farm work
himself.&nbsp; Wonderful, he have&mdash;eh, he shapes wonderful
well for a lad of his years.&nbsp; Mr Gradwell, now, o&rsquo;
Little Upton, he was passin&rsquo; the remark to me only
t&rsquo;other day.&nbsp; Says he, &lsquo;I never did see sech a
long head as your Luke have got for sech a young chap,&rsquo; he
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; exclaimed Farmer Barnes appreciatively,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s a fine lad, I&rsquo;ll say that for him.&nbsp;
He used to follow your poor master same as his shadow.&nbsp; I
reckon &rsquo;twas your Joe what put him in the way of things so
well.&nbsp; I reckon,&rdquo; he continued sympathetically,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been proud on him if he&rsquo;d
ha&rsquo; lived, poor owd lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he would,&rdquo; agreed Mrs Wharton, puckering
up her face and producing her handkerchief; from the turn the
conversation was now taking she would have soon to cry again.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Barnes, &ldquo;your lad, I
reckon he&rsquo;s a comfort to you, Mrs Wharton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Wharton twitched down her handkerchief and spoke in a
voice that was exceedingly clear and decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mester Barnes, he is an&rsquo; he isn&rsquo;t, if
ye know what I mean.&nbsp; There can&rsquo;t be two masters in
one house, and that&rsquo;s what I say&mdash;time and again I say
it to our Luke.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m fair tired sayin&rsquo; the same
thing over and over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer nodded with a kind of groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest so, Mrs Wharton, jest so.&nbsp; I can feel for ye
there.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the very same way wi&rsquo; me an&rsquo;
our Maimie.&nbsp; I do tell her a thing twenty times may-hap,
an&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll forget jest same, not but what she&rsquo;s
a good lass&mdash;I&rsquo;d reckon you&rsquo;d find her a good
lass, Mrs Wharton, if you was to coom here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, Mr Barnes,&rdquo; said the widow bashfully,
&ldquo;whatever put that in your head?&nbsp; Coom here,
d&rsquo;ye say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This &rsquo;ere house,&rdquo; said Jim firmly,
&ldquo;wants a missus summat awful, an&rsquo; I want a missus to
see to things an&rsquo; keep the young folks in order, and
there&rsquo;s nobry in the parish I&rsquo;d like better nor
yourself, Mrs Wharton.&nbsp; You an&rsquo; me can feel for each
other&mdash;ah, that we can&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo;
in the world to prevent us from lendin&rsquo; each other a
helpin&rsquo; hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Wharton paused to reflect, pleating the edge of her
black-edged handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there was but you an&rsquo; me,&rdquo; she said
presently, &ldquo;the matter &rsquo;ud be easy settled.&nbsp; I
could do wi&rsquo; you <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>very well, Mester Barnes.&nbsp; As
ye say, we can feel for one another&mdash;but there&rsquo;s the
childer to be thought on&mdash;all they little lads o&rsquo;
mine&mdash;there is but the one lass, ye know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more the merrier,&rdquo; returned Jim
placidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty o&rsquo; little odd
jobs they can be doin&rsquo; on, at arter school be over.&nbsp; I
often wish I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; had more lads
mysel&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; continued Mrs Wharton, to whom the
various aspects of the situation were slowly unfolding
themselves, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s your big lass to be thought
on&mdash;your Maimie.&nbsp; I doubt she&rsquo;ll not make it so
very pleasant for me.&nbsp; I could manage the little ones right
enough&mdash;I was allus fond o&rsquo; childer.&nbsp; But your
Maimie&mdash;I doubt we shouldn&rsquo;t get on so very well
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ye&rsquo;d get on,&rdquo; said Barnes,
&ldquo;ye&rsquo;d get on at arter a bit, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not speak very confidently, however, and presently
continued in a still more dubious tone: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis your
Luke as is a bit of a stumblin&rsquo; block.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t
reckoned he were that masterful.&nbsp; I doubt it&rsquo;ll not be
easy to get him to content hissel&rsquo; wi&rsquo; workin&rsquo;
here under me, at arter he&rsquo;s been cock o&rsquo; the walk at
your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Workin&rsquo; here under you,&rdquo; repeated Mrs
Wharton blankly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d never do
that&mdash;never.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know however it&rsquo;s to
be managed, Mester Barnes, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
reckon to leave our place, ye see.&nbsp; I reckoned&mdash;well
the thought jest happened to strike me, as if I was to take a
second husband he&rsquo;d be content to coom an&rsquo; live at
the Pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farmer Barnes rolled his head from side to side, <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>and gazed
at the good woman with a sternly disapproving air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t suit me,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;nay, that it wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Our family have been
settled here for a hundred year an&rsquo; more; I bain&rsquo;t
a-goin&rsquo; to shift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Mrs Wharton considered.&nbsp; She was not disposed to
relinquish her rights without a struggle, but, on the other hand,
Jim Barnes was the most eligible suitor who was likely to come
her way.&nbsp; The widowed state of both seemed to make the
alliance peculiarly desirable; none of the neighbours could cast
up at her for replacing poor Joe so soon when her second husband
stood as much in need of consolation as herself.&nbsp; Then he
was well-to-do, and a most excellent father.&nbsp; She had
thought, moreover, that his support would have enabled her to get
the better of the recalcitrant Luke.&nbsp; But there were limits
which could not be outstepped.&nbsp; To expect a youth of
twenty-two to accept a subordinate position on strange premises
was too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pit Farm is a very fine farm,&rdquo; she remarked
tentatively, after a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Whartons have lived
there a good few year too.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but nat&rsquo;ral as
our Luke should look to steppin&rsquo; into his feyther&rsquo;s
shoes some day when I&rsquo;m laid under ground.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
what he&rsquo;ve a right to expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let the lad step into &rsquo;em now, then,&rdquo;
exclaimed Jim Barnes jovially.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let him step
away.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to be gaffer at the Pit Farm; all
as I want, my dear, is for you to come an&rsquo; be missus
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Wharton relaxed.&nbsp; When her wooer smiled so pleasantly
and called her &ldquo;my dear,&rdquo; it was difficult <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>to maintain
an attitude of aloofness; nevertheless, though her heart was
insensibly softening, her shrewd, stolid North-country head by no
means followed suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a deal to be thought on, isn&rsquo;t
there?&rdquo; she remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our Luke&mdash;if I was
to let our Luke set up for hissel&rsquo; at our place,
there&rsquo;d be no doin&rsquo; anythin&rsquo; wi&rsquo;
him.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the lad&rsquo;s ower young too to be
livin&rsquo; alone there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why need he live alone?&rdquo; interrupted Jim.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pick out a wife for him&mdash;that&rsquo;s what ye&rsquo;d
best do&mdash;pick out a wife for him an&rsquo; let the yoong
folks set up there, and you coom here along o&rsquo;
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Wharton smiled dubiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;It met be a good
thing in one way,&rdquo; she conceded, &ldquo;but
still&mdash;well, ye see, I didn&rsquo;t reckon to give up the
Pit Farm to our Luke for a good few year yet.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
all the little uns to bring up and eddicate.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t expect to be lookin&rsquo; to you for
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Jim, becoming suddenly
very solemn.&nbsp; He, too, had heard about the good bit of brass
that was laid by, and, as every sensible person knew, when brass
was laid by, it was laid by, until the time came for the
fortunate possessor to leave it by will to somebody else.&nbsp;
Still he had not reckoned on the possible contingency of having
to feed and clothe at his expense the five younger Whartons.</p>
<p>After deep meditation, he struck the table with his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not make the chap pay ye rent for it?&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;That &rsquo;ud be the thing.&nbsp; Set him up
there an&rsquo; pick him out a missus, an&rsquo; let the two of
&rsquo;em manage <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>for themselves, and pay ye a lump sum every
rent-day&mdash;a good sum, mind ye, so as Mester Luke
mayn&rsquo;t be kickin&rsquo; up his heels an&rsquo;
thinkin&rsquo; too much of hissel&rsquo;.&nbsp; Coom,&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;what d&rsquo;ye think o&rsquo; that
notion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think well on&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mrs Wharton,
pursing up her lips, and nodding with a satisfied air.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think &rsquo;tis a capital notion, Mester Barnes.&nbsp;
I must just turn ower in my mind a bit, the lasses I&rsquo;d like
our Luke to choose from.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Sally Lupton now;
she&rsquo;s a nice little body, an&rsquo; folks say owd Lupton
left a good bit to her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;she met do very
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s Rose Blanchard,&rdquo;
continued Mrs Wharton, ruminating, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a nice
lass; wonderful house-proud Rose is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; agreed Barnes, nodding.</p>
<p>Mrs Wharton was struck by something peculiar in his tone, and
looked at him sharply; a deeper shade of colour was slowly
overspreading his face, and he was smiling in an oddly bashful
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can ye call to mind no other lass?&rdquo; he said,
after a pause, and, edging his chair round the table, he nudged
the widow meaningly.</p>
<p>A light suddenly dawned on Mrs Wharton; she began to laugh
with a rather conscious look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, theer&rsquo;s one lass as &rsquo;ud suit very
well.&nbsp; In more ways nor one she&rsquo;d suit, I reckon; but
I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know whatever you&rsquo;d say to it,
Mester Barnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her a name,&rdquo; said Jim, grinning more
broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I hardly like&mdash;&rsquo;t &rsquo;ud coom
best fro&rsquo; you, <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Mester Barnes; but she&rsquo;s a
very nice lass, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve heard as her mother left a
nice bit o&rsquo; money behind her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanin&rsquo; my missus,&rdquo; shouted Jim, the smiles
forsaking his face immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I named no names, Mester Barnes, though I did hear
that poor Martha had a nice bit put away in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she had, an&rsquo; maybe she hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
said Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;As how &rsquo;tis, whatever was left was
left to me, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s me as&rsquo;ll have the
settlin&rsquo; on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course&mdash;I&rsquo;m only
sayin&rsquo;&mdash;blood&rsquo;s thicker nor water, when
all&rsquo;s said an&rsquo; done, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis indeed, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure
that&rsquo;s a sayin&rsquo; as you&rsquo;ll bear in mind, my
dear, when you&rsquo;re setting your Luke up.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
his feyther&rsquo;s son, ye know, an&rsquo; what did his feyther
lay by so mich brass for, if not for the lad as is to stand in
his shoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a twinkle in honest Jim&rsquo;s eyes as he made this
home-thrust, and when Mrs Wharton replied, it was with a sort of
giggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be sure, he&rsquo;s to stand in&rsquo;s
feyther&rsquo;s shoes, poor lad, but I doubt he&rsquo;ll find
&rsquo;em a tight fit if I take your advice, Mester Barnes,
an&rsquo; make him pay me a big lump o&rsquo; rent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye had me there, Lizzie,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
hadn&rsquo;t give a thought to the chance o&rsquo; my lass
settin&rsquo; up along o&rsquo; your lad when I gave you that
there advice, my dear.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as broad as &rsquo;tis
long, that&rsquo;s one thing&mdash;&rsquo;twill be but
takin&rsquo; the brass out o&rsquo; one pocket and puttin&rsquo;
it into another.&nbsp; Blood&rsquo;s thicker nor water, <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>as ye said
just now.&nbsp; I doubt we&rsquo;ll agree very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt we shall,&rdquo; said Mrs Wharton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the first thing agreed on is that you an&rsquo;
me is to be shouted soon,&rdquo; pursued Jim, smiling, &ldquo;and
next thing is to tackle the yoong folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reet,&rdquo; said Mrs Wharton.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;ll have a quiet talk wi&rsquo; your lass at arter
we&rsquo;re gone, I&rsquo;ll say a word to our Luke while
we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried the farmer, rising, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
never one for half-measures.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s have the pair of
&rsquo;em in now, and put it to &rsquo;em straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Mrs Wharton had time to protest, he had thrown open the
door, and was shouting lustily for Luke and Maimie.</p>
<p>After a moment or two the young couple appeared, Maimie,
rather pale and inclined to be tearful, Luke, flushed and
determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coom in, my lad,&rdquo; shouted Barnes, clapping him
cheerily on the back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Coom your ways in Maimie, too:
we&rsquo;n summat to tell ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; we&rsquo;n summat to say, too,&rdquo; said
Luke, firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother, I know very well what
you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to say, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo;
my say out first.&nbsp; You an&rsquo; Mester Barnes here are
goin&rsquo; to make a match on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Well, Maimie
an&rsquo; me has been talkin&rsquo; a bit, an&rsquo; though
we&rsquo;re not wishful any way to hurt your feelin&rsquo;s,
we&rsquo;ve made up our minds, both on us, as we&rsquo;ll not
stop here to have strangers set over us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farmer Barnes whistled, and Mrs Wharton, whose wits, as has
been said, moved slowly, looked a trifle alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what we&rsquo;ve settled,&rdquo; continued Luke, <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>resolutely,
yet looking from his mother to the farmer, with a kind of
compassion, for he felt that the blow which he found himself
obliged to deal them, was of a staggering nature, &ldquo;what
we&rsquo;ve made up our minds to do is to get wed to each other
and go away to earn our own livin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; a very good notion too,&rdquo; said Jim
approvingly, sidling the while towards Mrs Wharton, and winking
solemnly as he intercepted her somewhat startled gaze.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a very good job as ye&rsquo;ve settled the
matter that way, my lad&mdash;&rsquo;twas the very thing me
an&rsquo; your mother was thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; proposin&rsquo;
to ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, feyther, ye&rsquo;d never be so cruel as to want to
turn me fro&rsquo; the door,&rdquo; gasped Maimie, her ready
tears bursting forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed Luke, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s a pretty thing, I will say.&nbsp; Have ye the face
to tell me, mother, as you an&rsquo; Mester Barnes had made it up
between ye to get shut of us&mdash;your own flesh &rsquo;an
blood, for the sake o&rsquo; takin&rsquo; up wi&rsquo; each
other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barnes, who had by this time reached Mrs Wharton&rsquo;s
chair, gave her a warning nudge with his elbow, and winked
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, lad, me an&rsquo; your mother is not for
turnin&rsquo; ye out, but if you an&rsquo; our Maimie have
settled everything between yourselves we haven&rsquo;t
nothin&rsquo; to say, have we Lizzie?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a very
good thing for young folks to earn their own livin&rsquo;&mdash;a
very good thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke and Maimie looked at each other blankly.&nbsp; The bomb
which they had expected to discharge with such deadly effect had
unaccountably fizzled <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>off; nobody seemed a penny the worse
for it.&nbsp; On the contrary, this plan, which they had expected
to be so strenuously opposed, appeared to suit the older couple
to a nicety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Luke, drawing a long breath,
&ldquo;what I says I&rsquo;ll stick to.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ll
keep your word to me, Maimie, I&rsquo;ll keep mine to you.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a bit hard to turn out of the old place after
bein&rsquo; brought up to look for somethin&rsquo; so different,
an&rsquo; I doubt you&rsquo;ll find it a bit hard too, my lass,
to settle down in a little small cottage&mdash;I doubt if your
mother were alive&mdash;or my poor feyther, as thought such a
dale o&rsquo; me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, choking; there were tears in his blue eyes.</p>
<p>Mrs Wharton could stand it no longer; rising hurriedly from
her chair, she pushed the farmer on one side, and, squeezing
herself round the table, threw her arms round Luke&rsquo;s
neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my lad,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;nay, dunnot
believe it.&nbsp; Dunnot think as your mother could ever be that
&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; Ye shannot be treated no worse nor if your
feyther wer alive&mdash;maybe a bit better, for our gaffer were
wonderful masterful, and I doubt he&rsquo;d not be the one to
turn out to make room for thee the same as I&rsquo;m
thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke, who had been warmly returning his mother&rsquo;s
embrace, now jerked up a somewhat ruffled head, his flushed face
disclosing distinct traces of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that ye say, mother?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jim had been shaking his head waggishly at Maimie,
and uplifting an admonitory forefinger.</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>&ldquo;Well, of all the little noddies!&nbsp; So
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to turn thee out, am I, to shift for
thysel&rsquo;.&nbsp; Water&rsquo;s thicker nor blood, I
s&rsquo;pose, ho, ho, ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed prodigiously at his own wit, and Maimie dashed away
her tears and smiled a doubtful smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mester Barnes and me,&rdquo; said Mrs Wharton solemnly,
&ldquo;have made up we&rsquo;re minds for to get wed, him
bein&rsquo; in want of a missus an&rsquo; me bein&rsquo; that
awful lonesome wi&rsquo;out your poor feyther, Luke, as I feel I
mun put soombry in&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well said,&rdquo; interpolated the farmer, in a
deep and admiring growl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At same time,&rdquo; continued Mrs Wharton, &ldquo;we
both knows our dooty to our childer, an&rsquo; we think the best
way o&rsquo; settlin&rsquo; the matter &rsquo;ud be for me to
live here at arter we are wed, and for you, Luke, to stop on at
the Pit wi&rsquo; Maimie for your missus.&nbsp; Mester Barnes
an&rsquo; me,&rdquo; she added, looking towards her newly-chosen
partner for confirmation of her words, &ldquo;&rsquo;ull give an
eye to things from time to time&mdash;me inside an&rsquo; him
out.&nbsp; An&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll have to pay me rent for the
place, ye know, Luke&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allowin&rsquo; yoursel&rsquo; a fair profit, o&rsquo;
course,&rdquo; interposed Farmer Barnes, &ldquo;a fair
profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; Mester Barnes bein&rsquo; a lovin&rsquo;
feyther, an&rsquo; mindful o&rsquo; what his poor missus
&rsquo;ud wish,&rdquo; continued the widow, &ldquo;&rsquo;ull
help ye to start, my lad&mdash;for stock an&rsquo; that.&nbsp;
Ah, ye may be sure we&rsquo;s both do the best we can for our own
flesh an&rsquo; blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke smiled broadly on his future stepfather, and gripped his
sunburnt hand, murmuring heartily: <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very well done
o&rsquo; you, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; Very handsome&mdash;ah, that
&rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maimie had crossed over to Mrs Wharton and was uttering on her
side profuse expressions of gratitude and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Jim Barnes himself, however, looked slightly puzzled, and
presently took occasion to murmur surreptitiously in Mrs
Wharton&rsquo;s ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye had the last word arter all, Lizzie, my
dear!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>THE
MISSUS&rsquo;S CHAIR</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the congregation of St
Mary&rsquo;s Church, Thornleigh, came gaily forth on Christmas
Day, pausing in the porch and on the steps, and almost blocking
the gateway as they exchanged cheery greetings and good wishes
with friends and neighbours, old Joe Makin loitered behind.&nbsp;
He spoke to no one, scarcely venturing to show himself, it would
appear, till the merry groups had dispersed and the last gleeful
youngster had come clattering down from his place in the choir,
and scampered off to join the family circle.</p>
<p>When all at last was still, Joe came slowly out, pulling his
hat-brim down over his eyes, and looking neither to right nor to
left.&nbsp; Instead of, however, descending the steps that led to
the lich-gate he went hobbling round to the rear of the church,
and then paused before one of the graves.</p>
<p>The headstone bore the name of Annie, only child of Joseph and
Mary Makin, and recorded her death as having taken place at a
date full thirty-five years distant.&nbsp; Lower down was another
inscription in memory of the aforesaid Mary Makin, who had
departed this life, it seemed, but a few months before that very
Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Joe looked round to assure himself that no one was in sight,
and then, stooping stiffly, endeavoured to brush away with his
hand the slight sprinkling of <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>snow which had fallen on the little
mound.&nbsp; Drawing a pair of scissors from his capacious
pocket, he clipped the grass here and there where it had grown
rank, muttering to himself the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t much harm, I don&rsquo;t
think&mdash;nay, it canna be much harm, though it is Christmas
Day, just to fettle it up a bit for our Mary.&nbsp; Hoo allus
liked everything gradely&mdash;eh, that hoo did.&nbsp; Now hoo
must have a bit o&rsquo; green to mak her know &rsquo;tis
Christmas&mdash;ah, and the little &rsquo;un too.&nbsp; Annie
shall have a sprig wi&rsquo; some pratty berries
on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took from beneath his coat two sprigs of holly, and after
some difficulty succeeded in sticking them upright into the
half-frozen ground, the larger one at the head of the grave, the
smaller, all gay with red berries, at the foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theer, owd lass,&rdquo; he said, straightening himself
at last, &ldquo;thou shall have a bit o&rsquo; green at head
o&rsquo; thy bed same as ever&mdash;eh, I could wish I were
a-layin&rsquo; theer aside o&rsquo; thee&mdash;Can&rsquo;st thou
see the berries, little wench, wheer thou art, up
yon?&mdash;Well&mdash;I mun be off a-whoam now.&nbsp; Eh, but the
grave looks gradely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat comforted by this reflection he turned about, and set
off homewards.</p>
<p>There were few loiterers in the village street; every one was
indoors, either preparing for, or already partaking of, the
Christmas dinner.&nbsp; When Lancashire folks make merry they
like, as they say, to have plenty &ldquo;to mak&rsquo; merry
wi&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; For weeks, nay, months past, thrifty
housewives had been looking forward to this day, and not a little
self-denial had been practised in order to ensure the <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>keeping of
it with becoming lavishness.&nbsp; From every house that Joe
passed issued sounds of cheerful bustle, jests and laughter; he
could see the firelight glancing on the window-panes, and catch
glimpses of wonderful decorations in the way of cut paper and
greenery.&nbsp; Here and there a little head would be pressed
against the shining pane to watch for some belated guest; now and
again he would hear a greeting exchanged between one and another;
&ldquo;Merry Christmas, owd lad!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The same to
you, man!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then the chairs would draw up and
there would be a clatter of plates, and a very babel of
acclamations would declare the goose or the bit o&rsquo; beef to
be the finest that ever was seen.&nbsp; Joe was going to have a
goose for his Christmas dinner; he had always subscribed to a
goose club in his missus&rsquo;s time, and he had not yet learned
to get into new ways; but the thought of that goose of which he
was to partake in absolute solitude served only to increase his
melancholy.</p>
<p>Poor Mary! how she would have enjoyed it&mdash;and she lay
yonder in the cold ground.</p>
<p>When he arrived at his cottage he took the door-key from its
usual hiding-place behind the loose brick under the ivy, and let
himself in.</p>
<p>Widow Prescott, who &ldquo;did for him&rdquo; now, had made
everything ready before she had taken her departure for her own
home.&nbsp; A savoury smell came from the oven where the goose
and the pudding (sent as usual from the Hall) were keeping hot;
the cloth was laid, the hearth swept up; the good woman had even
garnished the place with a sprig of green, here and there; but
the table was laid for one, and the <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>missus&rsquo;s chair stood against
the wall.&nbsp; Joe stood still and looked at it, slowly shaking
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, theer it stands,&rdquo; he said, speaking aloud,
according to his custom, &ldquo;theer it stands.&nbsp; Eh dear,
an&rsquo; her and me have sat opposite to each for such a many
years!&nbsp; And theer&rsquo;s the cheer empty, and here am I all
by mysel&rsquo;, and it&rsquo;s Christmas Day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wiped his eyes and shook his head again; then he slowly
divested himself of his hat and coat, which he hung up behind the
door, set the goose and potatoes on the table, and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what we are about to receive&mdash;&rdquo; began
Joe, dismally, and then he suddenly got on to his feet
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that theer cheer at the table
as how &rsquo;tis,&rdquo; said he, and hobbled across the floor
towards it.</p>
<p>Then, as though struck by a sudden thought, he continued in an
altered voice, &ldquo;Pull up, missus, draw a bit nearer,
lass.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;s get to
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dragged the chair over to the table, and set a plate in
front of it, and a knife and fork, and reached down a cup from
the dresser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;s have a cup o&rsquo; tea jest now,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;thou allus liked a cup o&rsquo; tea to thy
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to his place he sat down once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; shift to think thou&rsquo;s
theer,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll happen be able to
eat a bit if I can fancy thou&rsquo;s theer.&nbsp; I reckon
thou&rsquo;rt very like to be near me somewheer, owd lass; thou
an&rsquo; me as was never parted for a day for nigh upon forty
year, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t very like as thou&rsquo;d let me keep
Christmas all by mysel&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>He
was so busy talking to himself that he did not notice that the
latch of the house door, which opened directly into the place,
was lifted, as though by a hesitating hand, and that the door
itself was softly pushed a very little way open.</p>
<p>Taking up the carving-knife he cut a slice from the breast of
the goose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt have a little bit?&rdquo; he asked, looking
towards the empty chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; said a little voice behind him; the
door was opened and closed again, and little feet came pattering
hastily across the floor.</p>
<p>Joe dropped the knife and fork and looked round; a small
figure stood at his elbow, a dimpled face surmounted by a very
mop of yellow curls, was eagerly lifted to meet his gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; cried Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; echoed the little creature, and catching
hold of his sleeve, the child added in a tone of delighted
anticipation, &ldquo;Please, I could like a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, whose little lass are you?&rdquo; inquired the old
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what brings ye out on Christmas Day?&nbsp;
Why, thou&rsquo;rt starved wi&rsquo; cowd, an&rsquo; never a hat
a-top of all they curls, an&rsquo; not so much as a bit o&rsquo;
shawl to hap thee round.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s thy name, my
wench?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jinny, please, Mr Makin,&rdquo; announced she;
&ldquo;Jinny Frith.&nbsp; I am John Frith&rsquo;s little
lass&mdash;John o&rsquo; Joe&rsquo;s, ye know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and what brings ye out
in the cowd?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>Here
the little face became overcast, and the little lip drooped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother put me in the wash-house,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hoo wouldn&rsquo;t let me sit at table; hoo put me in the
wash-house, and I saw your fire shinin&rsquo; through the window,
and I thought I&rsquo;d come and ax ye to let me come in and warm
mysel&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, an&rsquo; so I will,&rdquo; returned Joe,
heartily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Put ye in the wash-house, did hoo?&nbsp;
Well, and that&rsquo;s a tale.&nbsp; Hoo&rsquo;s thy stepmother,
isn&rsquo;t hoo?&nbsp; Ah, I mind it now, I mind hearin&rsquo;
thy feyther &rsquo;ad getten a new wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny nodded, &ldquo;An&rsquo; a lot o&rsquo; new
childer!&rdquo; she announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Tommy,
an&rsquo; Teddy, an&rsquo; Maggie, an&rsquo; Pollie, mother
brought &rsquo;em all wi&rsquo; her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, she was a widow, was she?&rdquo; queried Joe,
interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s quite a new baby,&rdquo;
continued Jinny, opening her eyes wide, &ldquo;a new, little, wee
baby.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my own sister.&nbsp; Hoo&rsquo;s so
bonny, nobbut when hoo cries.&nbsp; Hoo cried jest now along
o&rsquo; me makin&rsquo; a noise, and mother was some
mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but your mother didn&rsquo;t ought to have put ye
in the wash-house for that,&rdquo; returned Joe.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
didn&rsquo;t go for to wakken the babby a-purpose.&nbsp; Theer,
coom nigh the fire and warm thysel&rsquo; a bit.&nbsp; Eh, what
little cowd hands.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that theer on thy
arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny turned her chubby arm and examined the mark
reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;&rsquo;twas where
mother hit <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>me with a spoon yesterday.&nbsp; I wer&rsquo;
reachin&rsquo; for the sugar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo hit ye, did hoo?&rdquo; cried Joe, with a sort of
roar.&nbsp; &ldquo;My word! the woman mun ha&rsquo; a hard heart
to hit a little lass same as thee.&nbsp; What was feyther doing,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feyther was eatin&rsquo; his breakfast,&rdquo;
responded Jinny.&nbsp; &ldquo;He said hoo didn&rsquo;t ought to
hit me&mdash;and then hoo got agate o&rsquo; bargein&rsquo; at
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; commented Joe, who had been chafing
the little cold hands throughout the recital, &ldquo;the poor
man&rsquo;s pretty well moidered, I reckon.&nbsp; But coom! the
goose &rsquo;ull soon be as cowd as thee if we don&rsquo;t give
over talkin&rsquo; an&rsquo; start eatin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
Thou&rsquo;d like a bit o&rsquo; goose, wouldn&rsquo;t
thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, I would!&rdquo; cried Jinny, with such whole-souled
earnestness that he laughed again.</p>
<p>Breaking from him she clambered into the chair opposite to his
own&mdash;poor Mary&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; And there she sat, her
feet a long way from the floor, but the better able on that
account to give certain little kicks to the table in token of
ecstasy.</p>
<p>Joe looked across at her: how strange to see that chubby face,
and golden head, in the place of the kindly wrinkled countenance
which had so often smiled affectionately back at him from between
the closely pleated frills of Mary&rsquo;s antiquated cap!&nbsp;
But the chair was no longer empty, and, though Joe sighed as he
took up his knife and fork, he thought that the tangible vision
of the expectant little face was, on the whole, more conducive to
dispel <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>loneliness than the most determined attempts at
make-believe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo&rsquo;s not theer,&rdquo; he muttered;
&ldquo;hoo&rsquo;ll never be theer no more, but it&rsquo;s a good
job as yon little lass chanced to look in&mdash;&rsquo;tis better
nor the wash-house for the little thing, as how
&rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who shall say how Jinny revelled in the goose, and the
stuffing, and the apple-sauce&mdash;particularly in the
apple-sauce?&nbsp; It was pleasant to see the solemnity with
which she presently selected the biggest potato in the dish, and,
sliding down from her chair, marched round the table to bestow it
on her host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You deserve it,&rdquo; said she, with a quaintly
condescending air&mdash;&ldquo;you are so good.&nbsp; Besides you
are the owdest,&rdquo; she added as an after thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to be sure!&rdquo; ejaculated Joe, leaning back
in his chair the better to clap his hands.</p>
<p>Then, of course, Jinny was obliged to peel the potato for Joe,
and to cut it up for him; she would in fact have liked to feed
him, had not a timely suggestion as to the advisability of
continuing her own dinner recalled her attention to that very
important matter.</p>
<p>When the pudding came, she insisted on measuring plates to
make quite sure that Joe was not defrauding himself of any
portion of his just share; and was altogether so judicious and
patronising, not to say motherly, that the old man partook of the
repast to an accompaniment of perpetual chuckles.&nbsp; His
delight was greatest, perhaps, when Jinny <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>insisted on
&ldquo;siding&rdquo; the dinner things at the conclusion of the
meal, a task which she accomplished with most business-like
dexterity.&nbsp; One by one she carried away dishes and
plates&mdash;having first taken the precaution of setting the
buttery door ajar&mdash;then she swept up the floor, and folded
the cloth, in a somewhat lop-sided manner it must be owned, but
with an air which left no doubt of her own consciousness of
efficiency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wash up by and by,&rdquo; she remarked, as
she returned to Joe&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, we&rsquo;ll not ax thee to do that,&rdquo; replied
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art a wonderful little lass.&nbsp; Thou
art, for sure!&nbsp; And nobbut six!&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;s a gradely
headpiece under they curls o&rsquo; thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My curls is all comin&rsquo; off,&rdquo; remarked
Jinny, with a little toss of the head that carried them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Joe, almost jumping from his
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to cut them all off,&rdquo;
explained the child.&nbsp; &ldquo;They take such a time
brushin&rsquo; out&mdash;and sometimes hoo pulls &rsquo;em
an&rsquo; hoo&rsquo;s vexed when I cry.&nbsp; So hoo says, Off
they must come.&nbsp; Daddy axed hoo to leave &rsquo;em till
Christmas, but I &rsquo;spect hoo&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em off
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that beats all!&rdquo; cried Joe, as profoundly
moved with indignation as though the decree had gone forth that
Jinny must lose her head instead of her hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
should think that any woman as is a woman, or for the matter
o&rsquo; that, anybody wi&rsquo; a heart in their breast, ought
to be glad and proud to <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>comb out they curls.&nbsp; For the
matter o&rsquo; that I&rsquo;d be willin&rsquo; to comb &rsquo;em
out mysel&rsquo;, if that&rsquo;s all the trouble.&nbsp; Coom
over here of a mornin&rsquo;, my wench, with thy brush an&rsquo;
comb, and I&rsquo;ll see to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will ye, Mr Makin?&rdquo; said Jinny, clapping her
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eh, ye are good!&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I say ye
was good?&nbsp; The goodest
mon&mdash;I&mdash;ever&mdash;did&mdash;see,&rdquo; she added with
emphasis.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I was your little lass,&rdquo; she
remarked, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye?&rdquo; returned Joe, setting aside the pipe
which he had been about to fill, and drawing her towards
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d never like to live wi&rsquo; an owd
mon same as me,&rdquo; he pursued in a hesitating tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nay, of course, ye wouldn&rsquo;t; ye&rsquo;d be awful
dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny shook her head till her curls made a yellow
nimbus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried with
emphasis.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to live here wi&rsquo; you,
Mr Makin.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d be my daddy then, wouldn&rsquo;t
ye?&nbsp; Were you ever a daddy, Mr Makin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long time ago,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;I had a little
lass o&rsquo; my own, and she&rsquo;d curly hair mich the same as
thine and bonny blue e&rsquo;en.&nbsp; Her little bed is up yon
in the top chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was your little lass I could sleep in her little
bed, couldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; returned Jinny, who was a practical
young person.&nbsp; &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s got a lot of new
childer&mdash;and I could like to have a new daddy.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d like <i>you</i> for my daddy, Mr Makin,&rdquo; she
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Joe, uplifting her dimpled chin
with his rugged forefinger, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a notion that; I
reckon I could do wi&rsquo; thee very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d
sleep&mdash;in&mdash;that&mdash;little&mdash;bed&mdash;up&mdash;yon,&rdquo;
resumed Jinny, in a sort of chant, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d sit in
this here chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With some difficulty she dragged over the missus&rsquo;s chair
to the opposite side of the hearth, and climbed into it.&nbsp;
There she sat with her curly head leaning against the back, a
little hand on each of its wooden arms, and her chubby legs
dangling.&nbsp; It was the missus&rsquo;s chair, but Joe did not
chide the presumptuous little occupant.&nbsp; On the contrary, he
gave a sort of one-sided nod at her, and winked with both eyes
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you are as grand as the Queen,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>While they were chuckling together over this sally, there came
a sound of hasty steps without, followed by a knock on the door;
and John Frith thrust in his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, thou&rsquo;rt theer!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My word, Jinny, what a fright thou&rsquo;s gi&rsquo;en
me.&nbsp; I thought thou was lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe removed his pipe from his mouth, and gazed at the newcomer
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo&rsquo;s here, reet enough,&rdquo; he
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit still, Jinny,&rdquo; as the child,
abashed, began to get down from the chair; &ldquo;thou&rsquo;s no
need to stir&mdash;coom in if ye are coming, John,&rdquo; he
added, over his shoulder, &ldquo;an&rsquo; shut yon door.&nbsp;
The wind blows in strong enough to send us up the
chimbley&mdash;Jinny and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John obediently closed the door, and came forward.&nbsp; He
was a big, loose-limbed, good-natured looking fellow, without
much headpiece the <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>neighbours said, but with his heart in the right
place.&nbsp; As he now advanced, his face wore an expression,
half of amusement, half of concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, whoever&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; thought of her
runnin&rsquo; off here!&rdquo; he ejaculated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s sich a to-do at our place as never
was.&nbsp; Some on &rsquo;em thought hoo&rsquo;d fallen down the
well.&nbsp; Eh, Jinny, thou&rsquo;lt catch it from mother.&nbsp;
Why didn&rsquo;t thou stop i&rsquo; th&rsquo;
wash-house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny began to whimper, but before she could reply, Joe Makin
took up the cudgels in her defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop in the wash-house indeed!&rdquo; cried he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; did ought to be ashamed o&rsquo;
yo&rsquo;rsel&rsquo;, John Prescott.&nbsp; Stop in th&rsquo;
wash-house on Christmas Day, to be starved wi&rsquo; cowd,
an&rsquo; clemmed wi&rsquo; hunger.&nbsp; &lsquo;I dunno how
yo&rsquo; can call yo&rsquo;rsel&rsquo; a mon an&rsquo; say sich
a thing&mdash;yo&rsquo;, as is her feyther an&rsquo;
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, dear o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; cried John,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis enough to drive a mon distracted, what
wi&rsquo; one thing an&rsquo; what wi&rsquo; another.&nbsp; I ax
naught but a quiet life.&nbsp; Jinny, hoo woke the babby, and the
missus, hoo got in one of her tantrums, an&rsquo; the childer was
all fightin&rsquo; an&rsquo; skrikin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the whole
place upside down&mdash;eh, theer&rsquo;s too many on &rsquo;em
yonder an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the truth, but if I say a word
hoo&rsquo;s down on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;re a gradely fool to ston&rsquo; it,
then!&rdquo; retorted Joe.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mon should be gaffer
in his own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t say but what he ought to be,&rdquo;
responded John, with a sheepish smile, &ldquo;but &rsquo;tis
easier said than done, mon: I weren&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>leave the
little lass in the wash-house,&rdquo; he added in an explanatory
tone, &ldquo;I were goin&rsquo; to let her out reet enough on the
quiet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d saved a bit o&rsquo; dinner for her,
too&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yo&rsquo; had, had yo&rsquo;?&rdquo; interrupted
Joe, ironically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Coom now, that&rsquo;s
summat.&nbsp; You weren&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to let her clem on
Christmas Day&mdash;well done!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas actin&rsquo;
like a mon, that was&mdash;yo&rsquo; may be proud o&rsquo; that,
John.&nbsp; I tell yo&rsquo; what,&rdquo; cried Joe, thumping the
table, &ldquo;since yo&rsquo; take no more thought for your own
flesh an&rsquo; blood nor that, yo&rsquo; may mak&rsquo; a
present o&rsquo; the little lass to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mak&rsquo; a present!&rdquo; stammered the other,
staring at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; returned Joe, sternly, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t vally her no more nor if hoo wer&rsquo; an owd
dish-clout&mdash;lettin&rsquo; her be thrown out in the
wash-house an&rsquo; all&mdash;but I&rsquo;m made
different.&nbsp; Your house is too full, yo&rsquo; say&mdash;well
mine&rsquo;s empty&mdash;awful empty,&rdquo; he added with
something like a groan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s too many on
yo&rsquo; yon, at your place&mdash;well, then, I&rsquo;ll take
Jinny off ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John still stared at him without speaking, and Joe continued
vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say I&rsquo;ll take her off yo&rsquo;.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;ll &rsquo;appen be more peace at yo&rsquo;r place
when the little wench is out of the road; an&rsquo; they curls
o&rsquo; hers may stop on her head instead o&rsquo; being cut off
an&rsquo; thrown in the midden&mdash;an&rsquo; if hoo axes for a
bit o&rsquo; sugar hoo shan&rsquo;t get hit wi&rsquo; a
spoon.&nbsp; Theer now,&rdquo; he summed up sternly.</p>
<p>John scratched his head and reflected.&nbsp; Jinny was his own
flesh and blood, and he loved her after <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>his
fashion; but there was no doubt things were very uncomfortable at
home, and if she were not there, there was likely to be more
peace.&nbsp; If Joe really meant what he said he might be worth
hearkening to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; seem to have taken a wonderful fancy to the
little lass,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly; &ldquo;hoo&rsquo;s a
good little lass enough, but&mdash;I reckon yo&rsquo;re
laughin&rsquo; at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wer&rsquo; never more in earnest i&rsquo; my
life,&rdquo; said Joe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Coom, it mun be one way or
t&rsquo;other.&nbsp; Mun I have her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can have her reet enough!&rdquo; returned the
father, with a shamefaced laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would ye like to
live here, Jinny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, I would!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eh, that I
would!&nbsp; He shall be my new daddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pang shot through her own father&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; yo&rsquo;ll think no more o&rsquo; the owd
one now, I reckon,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Jinny looked from one to the other quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two daddies!&rdquo; she said emphatically, adding after
a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two daddies and no
mother&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little lass!&rdquo; said John, with something like
a groan.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon thou would; I doubt I can&rsquo;t
blame thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis settled, then; I can keep her?&rdquo; cried
Joe eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; returned John, backing towards the door,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis reet&mdash;yo&rsquo; can keep her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the door closed behind him, Jinny returned to her big elbow
chair, and once more taking <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>possession of it, folded her hands
on her lap and announced triumphantly that she was the little
missus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless thy bonny face,&rdquo; cried Joe, &ldquo;and so
thou art.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>THE
RULES O&rsquo; THE HOUSE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Jinny Whiteside</span> had kept herself
without being beholden to anybody since she found herself an
orphan at the age of twenty-eight.&nbsp; She took in washing, she
went out charing; during her spare hours she worked in her
garden; but her main source of income came from letting her two
small spare bedrooms.&nbsp; Her cottage was situated at such a
convenient distance from the little wayside station, that the
constantly changing porters who earned their living there,
invariably became her lodgers.</p>
<p>One sunshiny May day the outgoing porter took leave of his
landlady&mdash;having been removed to a more important
station&mdash;and after giving him a hearty Godspeed, she stood
watching his departing figure, until she was presently hailed by
the voice of the porter who had come to take his place.&nbsp;
Looking round, she observed that his eyes were fixed on her with
a gaze that was half-amused and half-enquiring.&nbsp; Jinny
Whiteside was a pleasant enough sight that bright morning.&nbsp;
She wore the bedgown and petticoat which many of her neighbours
condemned as old-fashioned, but which she would have scorned to
discard; her print sleeves were rolled up high on her sturdy
arms, her fair hair shone like satin, and her sunburnt face was
<a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>smooth
and comely still in spite of her five-and-thirty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day to yo&rsquo;, missus,&rdquo; said the new
porter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; returned Jinny, removing her arms from
the gate on which she had been leaning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yo&rsquo;n
coom about the lodging, I reckon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dun yo&rsquo; know that?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s other cotes i&rsquo; this place besides
yo&rsquo;rs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cotes enough,&rdquo; agreed Jinny.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; can go an&rsquo; see &rsquo;em if yo&rsquo;n a
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll have a look round here
first,&rdquo; retorted he.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a pratty
place, an&rsquo; I doubt by the looks on yo&rsquo; yo&rsquo;re
wan as &rsquo;ud mak&rsquo; a mon comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny, with an unmoved face, led the way into the cottage and
piloted him upstairs, throwing open the door of the room just
vacated by her last lodger.&nbsp; The newcomer stepped past her
with a laugh; the highest part of the sloping ceiling touched his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not mich room to turn,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;n no need to turn, wi&rsquo;out it&rsquo;s to
turn in,&rdquo; replied Jinny, surveying him calmly, with her
hand resting on her hip; &ldquo;or mayhap,&rdquo; she continued
reflectively, &ldquo;yo&rsquo;d fancy turnin&rsquo; out.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not one to beg and pray yo&rsquo; to lodge wi&rsquo; me
again your will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How mich are you axin&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the visitor,
grinning appreciatively at this sally.</p>
<p>She named her terms, adding, &ldquo;Tak&rsquo; it or leave
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; it,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Theer, that job&rsquo;s sattled.&nbsp; Now then,
missus&mdash;Mrs Whiteside; that&rsquo;s yo&rsquo;r name,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;<i>Miss</i> Whiteside,&rdquo; corrected Jinny,
preceding him down the stairs, &ldquo;I were never
wed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, with a quizzical look, &ldquo;what
were the lads about?&nbsp; Well, Miss Whiteside, I hope you are
satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let yo&rsquo; know that at the
week-end,&rdquo; said Jinny.&nbsp; &ldquo;What met yo&rsquo;r
name be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luke Kershaw,&rdquo; responded he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tis as good a name as any other.&nbsp;
Theer&rsquo;s one thing, Luke, yo&rsquo; mun keep to the rules
o&rsquo; the house.&nbsp; Yo&rsquo;ll find out about &rsquo;em
soon enough,&rdquo; she added, in reply to his questioning
look.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fetch yo&rsquo;r things now, I mun get agate
wi&rsquo; my wark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Luke returned dinner was set forth, and his
fellow-lodger, who was likewise his fellow-servant at the railway
station, was already seated.&nbsp; Miss Whiteside set before them
a deep dish, containing thick slices of bacon done after the
incomparable rustic fashion, and emitting a most appetising
odour; and jerking open the oven-door, produced therefrom a tin
full of smoking potatoes, nicely browned in dripping, which she
rapidly proceeded to transfer to the hot dish lying ready to hand
before the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word,&rdquo; exclaimed Luke, rubbing his hands,
&ldquo;this is what yo&rsquo; may call a gradely do, John.&nbsp;
Does yon lass treat yo&rsquo; so well every day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noan so ill,&rdquo; interpolated Jinny, &ldquo;though
&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t always bacon day.&nbsp; Now then, pull up,
an&rsquo; we&rsquo;s ax a blessin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke duly drew his chair to the table, but instead of folding
his hands and bending his head after the <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>manner of
his comrade, stared at Miss Whiteside with a sarcastic
smile.&nbsp; Jinny eyed him sharply, dumped a portion of bacon
and potatoes on a plate, and remarking with some
asperity&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christians get sarved first in this cote,&rdquo; handed
it to John.&nbsp; Then, turning abruptly to Luke, and keeping her
big spoon poised in the air, she added: &ldquo;Mayhap yo&rsquo;
didn&rsquo;t know sayin&rsquo; grace at meal-times is one
o&rsquo; my rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; admitted Kershaw, still
grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yo&rsquo; know now, then,&rdquo; resumed Jinny,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; be for forgettin&rsquo;
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She helped him to his allotted portion, but, as Luke jealously
imagined, curtailed his allowance of bacon fat, though she had
generously spooned a large quantity of it into John&rsquo;s
plate.</p>
<p>He made no remark, however, and fell to with appetite,
remarking after a pause, that the folks at the public
hadn&rsquo;t sent up his little beer-barrel yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thot&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; said his landlady,
raising her eyes from her plate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ought haply to
ha&rsquo; named it this morn, for ye&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; the
trouble o&rsquo; takin&rsquo; back that order now.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t allow nobry to sup beer i&rsquo; this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh! my word!&rdquo; cried Luke, supplementing the
ejaculation with an oath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; want it all
yo&rsquo;r own way i&rsquo; this cote, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t allow no ill language neither,&rdquo;
observed Jinny.&nbsp; &ldquo;If yo&rsquo; can&rsquo;t get along
wi&rsquo;out usin&rsquo; bad words yo&rsquo; needn&rsquo;t be at
the trouble of unpackin&rsquo; that box o&rsquo;
yo&rsquo;rn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theer, don&rsquo;t get vexed,&rdquo; put in John, in a
stage whisper to his fellow workman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Humour her a <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>bit,
mon.&nbsp; Yo&rsquo;ll not rue it at arter, an&rsquo; so I tell
yo&rsquo;.&nbsp; A mon met search far an&rsquo; wide afore he
found hisself so weel done-to as we find ourselves
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mun I drink then?&rdquo; cried Luke
sullenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dry water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; can have coffee same as the rest on
us,&rdquo; returned Jinny.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
b&rsquo;ilin&rsquo; on the fire now, an&rsquo; &rsquo;ull be
ready as soon as yo&rsquo; are, I doubt.&nbsp; Ate yo&rsquo;r
bacon an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s hear so mich
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is talk forbidden too?&rdquo; enquired Luke, with a
dawning smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when it&rsquo;s gradely talk,&rdquo; responded his
hostess.&nbsp; &ldquo;If yo&rsquo;n anything to say, say it, but
I&rsquo;ll not be moidered wi&rsquo; grumblin&rsquo;s an&rsquo;
growlin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John plunged at once into an account of a chance meeting with
an old crony of his, who was also, it seemed a friend of Miss
Whiteside&rsquo;s, describing with a good deal of dry humour his
encounter with this gentleman, who was, it appeared, more nor a
little set up since he had shifted to Liverpool.&nbsp; Jinny
seemed much tickled, and interrupted the speaker every now and
then by a burst of laughter&mdash;very fresh and pleasant
laughter, her blue eyes twinkling the while in a way that was
equally pleasant.&nbsp; She was in such a good humour that at the
conclusion of the repast Luke was emboldened to produce his pipe,
and, after tentatively polishing it on his coat sleeve, held it
out to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I smoke,&rdquo; he asked ingratiatingly, &ldquo;or
is that again the rules too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Whiteside, surveying him
reflectively, &ldquo;if yo&rsquo; was ony kin o&rsquo; mine
I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; summat to say to yo&rsquo;, but if yo&rsquo;
choose to weer <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>yo&rsquo;r brass on baccy it&rsquo;s nobry&rsquo;s
business but yo&rsquo;r own.&nbsp; It keeps yo&rsquo; quiet,
an&rsquo; so long as yo&rsquo; stick to coffee for yo&rsquo;r
drink, theer&rsquo;s no harm in&rsquo;t as far as I can
see.&nbsp; Say grace afore yo&rsquo; leave the table
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Luke, if he did not openly join in the devotions,
had the good taste to sit quiet, and to keep his features
composed and his eyes downcast till the &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; after
which he lit his pipe and fell to smoking in silence.&nbsp; John,
who was no smoker, adjourned to the bench in the porch, and,
drawing a newspaper from his pocket, began to read.&nbsp;
Meanwhile Jinny &ldquo;sided&rdquo; the things, singing to
herself in a high, clear voice.&nbsp; Presently, catching up a
bucket, she went out; the creaking of a windlass was heard, and
in another minute she returned, the pail brimming over with
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;n a well here, I see,&rdquo; observed Luke,
removing his pipe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t make out what
the screeching was.&nbsp; Yo&rsquo; are rale owd-fashioned folks
hereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noan the war for thot,&rdquo; said Jinny.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; Manchester folks is so stuck-up yo&rsquo; reckon
to find pumps an&rsquo; taps an&rsquo; sich like i&rsquo;
th&rsquo; country.&nbsp; But yo&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; to put up
wi&rsquo; us same as yo&rsquo; find us.&nbsp; When yo&rsquo;r for
cl&rsquo;anin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;, yo&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; to fill
bucket for yo&rsquo;rsel&rsquo;, same as John yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, I&rsquo;ll fill it,&rdquo; responded Luke;
&ldquo;&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t so very mich trouble.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
ha&rsquo; filled yon for yo&rsquo; too if I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;
knowed what yo&rsquo; was arter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I&rsquo;d as soon do for mysel&rsquo;, thank
yo&rsquo;,&rdquo; retorted Jinny.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never was one as
fancied bein&rsquo; behowden to folks.&nbsp; Theer, &rsquo;tis
striking one,&rdquo; as <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>the cuckoo-clock on the
chimney-piece gave out a quavering note, &ldquo;yo&rsquo;d best
be steppin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke rose, pocketed his pipe, and followed John, who had
already folded up his newspaper and left his place in the
porch.&nbsp; They walked away together in silence until they were
out of earshot, and then Luke, with a slow grin and a backward
jerk of his head towards the cottage, remarked:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; owd lass seems awful religious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s thot,&rdquo; agreed John, &ldquo;but
she&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; the better mak&rsquo; for all
that.&nbsp; She dunnot preach nowt as she dunnot put i&rsquo;
practice, mon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I dunnot howd wi&rsquo; bein&rsquo; put upon as
how &rsquo;tis,&rdquo; retorted Luke defiantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m one as dunnot like to sup coffee when I&rsquo;ve
a mind to sup beer, an&rsquo; to be set down to say grace, same
as if I was a babby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all babbies here,&rdquo; said John, with a
grin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could laugh by times of a Sunday morn, when
we all sets out for church same as the infants in the
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Church!&rdquo; exclaimed Luke, his voice becoming
almost falsetto in its indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell yo&rsquo;
what&mdash;she&rsquo;ll find she&rsquo;s got hold o&rsquo; the
wrong mak&rsquo; o&rsquo; chap for they games.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
a rule as I made long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John laughed to himself in a way which increased the new
porter&rsquo;s ire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do yo&rsquo; mean by that?&rdquo; he enquired
sharply; &ldquo;theer&rsquo;s nought to laugh at as I can
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nobbut thinkin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;ll change
yo&rsquo;r tune afore long, same as the rest on us,&rdquo;
returned the other.&nbsp; <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>&ldquo;We all has to give in to Miss
Whiteside.&nbsp; Jem Phillips, as has just gone, he thought
he&rsquo;d have his own way about comin&rsquo; home late
fro&rsquo; the public, but she soon let him know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let her know then,&rdquo; growled Luke, in
the depths of his brown beard.</p>
<p>That very evening his resolution was put to the test.&nbsp; He
had preserved an ominous and gloomy silence throughout supper,
which, though plentiful and comfortably served, was rendered in a
manner distasteful to him by the compulsory devotions which had
preceded it; and observed in a loud voice at its conclusion, that
he intended to step out to the &ldquo;Blue Lion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Jinny received the information disapprovingly but calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not responsible for what yo&rsquo; do outside
o&rsquo; this house; yo&rsquo; can be as great a fool as
yo&rsquo; like,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;As long as
yo&rsquo; coom back sober, an&rsquo; not too late,&rdquo; she
added with emphasis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ten&rsquo;s my hour for going
to bed; I don&rsquo;t say but what I met stretch a point now
an&rsquo; then, an&rsquo; stop up till half-past ten, but folks
as comes home later nor that &rsquo;ull find theirsel&rsquo;s
locked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven&rsquo;s closin&rsquo; time,&rdquo; said Luke,
sulkily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose yo&rsquo; think
yo&rsquo;rsel&rsquo; better able to make laws nor the
government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I makes laws for my own house,&rdquo; responded Miss
Whiteside with dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always kept my &rsquo;ouse
respectable, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll go on doin&rsquo; of it.&nbsp;
No house can be respectable as takes a lodger out o&rsquo; they
crowd o&rsquo; shoutin&rsquo;, singin&rsquo; wastrels as nobbut
cooms whoam when they&rsquo;re turned out o&rsquo; the
public.&nbsp; If one o&rsquo; my lodgers is sich a noddy as to go
to the public at all <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>he mun walk out o&rsquo; his own
free will, an&rsquo; not wait to be turned out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of his own free will, indeed!&rdquo; commented Luke,
with an angry laugh; &ldquo;theer&rsquo;s not mich free will left
to ony chap as bides i&rsquo; this cote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please yo&rsquo;rself an&rsquo; yo&rsquo; please
me,&rdquo; said Jinny.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to keep
nobry here against their will, but if yo&rsquo; reckon to lodge
here yo&rsquo; must do same as I tell yo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve more nor half a mind to tak&rsquo; yon wench
at her word,&rdquo; muttered Kershaw, as he strode away,
accompanied by John, whom he had persuaded to join him for a
single glass, though, as the latter explained, in a general way
he was temperance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;ll do same as the rest on us&mdash;yo&rsquo;ll
give in.&nbsp; Eh, mon, yo&rsquo;ll not rue it I tell yo&rsquo;;
I&rsquo;ve been a dale &rsquo;appier an &rsquo;a dale better
sin&rsquo; Miss Whiteside took me in hand.&nbsp; An&rsquo; Mary
Frith, as I&rsquo;m keepin&rsquo; coompany with, says often
an&rsquo; often she blesses the day I went to lodge wi&rsquo;
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went into the &ldquo;Blue Lion,&rdquo; and John duly had
his glass, and departed amid the mirth of the assembled
company.&nbsp; One facetious person enquired, with apparent
innocence, but nudging his neighbour the while, if Luke did not
intend to accompany him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know the rules o&rsquo; the &rsquo;ouse,&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Whiteside &rsquo;ull be on the lookout
for ye, lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke&rsquo;s only response was to order himself another
three-penn&rsquo;orth; but being further pressed, he announced
with great valour his intention of showing yon wumman as
she&rsquo;d not get the better of him.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when
ten o&rsquo;clock drew near, he <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>began to fidget.&nbsp; Would Jinny
really carry out her threat of locking him out if he did not
appear at the appointed time?&nbsp; It was raining heavily,
someone had recently reported, he was tired, and the memory of
the snug little room under the roof appealed to him forcibly;
moreover he would infallibly become the laughing-stock of the
place if Jinny was as good as her word.&nbsp; When another
quarter of an hour had passed, therefore, he arose, stretched
himself, and remarked with feigned unconcern, that he was dog
tired and would be glad to turn in.&nbsp; The wag aforesaid
pulled out a huge Waterbury watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mak&rsquo; the best use o&rsquo; yo&rsquo;r legs,
mon,&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; have but ten
minutes to do the job.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo; the
bolt ready &rsquo;iled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke deemed it best to feign unconsciousness of the
other&rsquo;s meaning, and went slouching out of the house with
as much dignity as was compatible with a devil-may-care
aspect.&nbsp; He whistled loudly as he sauntered down the lane,
but once he had fairly left the inn and its occupants behind, he
took to his heels and ran.&nbsp; As he approached Jinny&rsquo;s
cottage, he observed with alarm that there was no light in the
kitchen windows, though, as he sent the little gate swinging on
its hinges, a faint ray shot through the keyhole of the
door.&nbsp; He lifted the latch but the door did not yield.&nbsp;
Then he struck the upper panel heavily with his clenched
fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;d best open this door, missus,&rdquo; he
shouted out, in a voice thick with anger, &ldquo;else I&rsquo;d
think nothin&rsquo; at all o&rsquo; breakin&rsquo; it
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a grinding of bolts within, and the door <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>was flung
open, revealing Miss Whiteside, flat candlestick in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look yo&rsquo; here, missus,&rdquo; cried Luke,
propping the door open with his broad shoulder, &ldquo;a
bargain&rsquo;s a bargain!&nbsp; Half-past ten was the time
yo&rsquo; named an&rsquo; it wants three minutes to that
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does nought o&rsquo; the kind,&rdquo; responded
Jinny indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cuckoo&rsquo;s gone five minutes
sin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cuckoo&rsquo;s wrong then,&rdquo; retorted Luke
roughly, and he dangled his watch in the flickering light in
order to confute her.&nbsp; Just as Jinny was shrilly asserting
her belief in the infallibility of her cuckoo, the church clock
struck the half-hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theer!&nbsp; What do yo&rsquo; mak&rsquo; o&rsquo;
thot?&rdquo; cried Luke, restoring his watch to his fob, and
stepping past her; &ldquo;church clock can&rsquo;t be wrong, can
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny, unexpectedly confounded, fell to re-bolting the door
again without speaking, and her lodger, triumphant in the
consciousness of having had the last word, marched up to bed.</p>
<p>Luke was awake early on the following morning, yet, when he
came downstairs to draw up a bucketful of water from the well, he
found that his hostess must have been astir long before
him.&nbsp; The kitchen had been scrubbed and sanded, a bright
fire burnt on the hearth, and a most savoury smell of coffee and
bacon greeted his nostrils.&nbsp; Moreover, Miss Whiteside,
kneeling before the fire, was toasting a large round of
bread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yon smells gradely,&rdquo; said Luke, pausing in the
doorway.</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>Jinny
glanced over her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yo&rsquo;,&rdquo; she remarked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I got yo&rsquo;r breakfast in good time, knowing yo&rsquo;
have to be on duty o&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coom,&rdquo; said Kershaw with a gleeful swing of the
bucket, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s reet.&nbsp; I call that proper
thoughtful.&nbsp; I reckoned I&rsquo;d happen have to tak&rsquo;
a bite along wi&rsquo; me, seein&rsquo; it&rsquo;s so
early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; responded Jinny graciously, as she scraped
the burnt corner off the toast; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for
sendin&rsquo; a man off to his wark wi&rsquo; some heart in
him&mdash;wi&rsquo;out it&rsquo;s too early for him to have a
appetite.&nbsp; Poor John &rsquo;ull have to come back for his
breakfast.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t expect the lad to be hungry at
five o&rsquo;clock i&rsquo; the mornin&rsquo;, though I made him
a nice cup o&rsquo; tea before he went, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll do
the same by yo&rsquo; next week when &rsquo;tis yo&rsquo;r turn
to be the early bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yo&rsquo;re something like a stirrin&rsquo;
body&mdash;I&rsquo;ll say that!&rdquo; cried Luke approvingly;
and he hurried out to the well, filled his bucket, and performed
his ablutions, all with the least possible loss of time, for
really the sights and smells in that comfortable kitchen made him
feel most uncommonly hungry.</p>
<p>Jinny had finished toasting the second round by the time he
appeared, and was covering the table with a coarse, clean, white
cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; cried Luke in high good humour,
&ldquo;if the meal&rsquo;s ready the mon is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set a chair in Jinny&rsquo;s place, and fetched another for
himself, and was about to sit down, when Jinny, who had
methodically arranged plates <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>and cups upon the table, glanced at
him reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prayers first,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m ready&mdash;fire away,&rdquo; grunted
Luke, bending his head and folding his hands in the approved
fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grace is one thing,&rdquo; observed Jinny,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; prayers another.&nbsp; Yo&rsquo;ll go down on
your knees, Luke Kershaw, along o&rsquo; me an&rsquo; say a word
to yo&rsquo;r Maker afore yo&rsquo; breaks bread i&rsquo; this
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m d&mdash;d if I do!&rdquo; shouted Luke,
thumping the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about tired o&rsquo;
bein&rsquo; missus&rsquo;d an&rsquo; so I tell yo&rsquo;.&nbsp;
Pray away as much as yo&rsquo; like, Miss
Whiteside&mdash;I&rsquo;ll step outside an&rsquo; yo&rsquo; can
call me when yo&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny shot a glance at him, and then, with the precision which
characterised all her actions, removed one plate, one cup and
saucer, and one knife and one fork from the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them as hasn&rsquo;t the decency to thank the Giver,
dunnot want the gifts,&rdquo; she observed, and flopped down on
her knees by the settle in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mak&rsquo; o&rsquo; talk&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
enquired Luke somewhat shamefacedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; know well enough,&rdquo; responded she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This here&rsquo;s a Christian house, I say, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll not set at table wi&rsquo; nobry as dunnot begin the
day as a Christian should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke made a step towards the door, and then glanced back at
the hearth.&nbsp; The two rounds of toast standing at right
angles to each other were <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>as brown as brown could be; the
bacon was done to perfection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mon must eat,&rdquo; he said, speaking more to
himself than to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;A chap can&rsquo;t do his work
wi&rsquo;out he&rsquo;s fed, but I&rsquo;ll look out for another
lodgin&rsquo; afore the day goes by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny, with her head buried in her hands, was too much
absorbed to heed him.&nbsp; Luke, after another moment&rsquo;s
hesitation, came shambling across the kitchen, and popped himself
down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno be too long, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he observed
in a wrathful whisper.</p>
<p>Miss Whiteside glanced at him between her fingers, and then
obligingly began to pray aloud.&nbsp; The devotions in which Luke
was invited, or rather commanded, to share, were not of very long
duration, and something about the simple, familiar words evoked
in him an unwonted sense of shame, which was increased by
Jinny&rsquo;s comment on concluding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twere scarce worth while to make such a fuss,
were it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He relinquished the idea of seeking lodgings elsewhere, and
moreover unpacked and stowed away his few possessions with a
certain sense of satisfaction.&nbsp; Jinny herself came upstairs
before he had finished, and immediately took possession of such
garments as required mending.&nbsp; The day passed peacefully
away.&nbsp; Luke, in fact, was lamb-like throughout the ensuing
week, not only as regarded saying his grace and refraining from
protest when the need for beer at the midday <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>meal made
itself felt, but even returning home from the &ldquo;Blue
Lion&rdquo; before the church clock struck ten.&nbsp; All in fact
went smoothly until Saturday evening when Jinny announced, in her
sharp, imperative manner, that she expected &ldquo;both
lads&rdquo; to be ready for church at a quarter to eleven
sharp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take us all that time to get theer,&rdquo;
she observed, with the corner of her eye on Luke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;d best look sharp an&rsquo; see that
yo&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; observed the latter, addressing himself
to John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows right enough,&rdquo; said Miss Whiteside
quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s yo&rsquo; as &rsquo;ull have to
look sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; rejoined Kershaw
firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but you are,&rdquo; responded Jinny, uplifting her
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the rule o&rsquo; the house.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve never had a lodger yet as didn&rsquo;t go to
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;ll have one now, then,&rdquo; retorted Luke,
tapping the ashes out of his pipe and rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s sausages for breakfast to-morrow,&rdquo;
remarked Jinny, with apparent irrelevance.</p>
<p>Luke burst out laughing:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; think I&rsquo;m a child, I doubt,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;No breakfast for a bad lad.&nbsp; Well, it
won&rsquo;t hurt me to go wi&rsquo;out my breakfast for
once.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; to church&mdash;I tell
yo&rsquo; plain.&nbsp; Yo&rsquo; have yo&rsquo;r rules an&rsquo;
I have mine.&nbsp; I fell out wi&rsquo; a parson once as took on
hissel&rsquo; to interfere wi&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; I says to him
what I says to yo&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never set foot
&rsquo;ithin a church again&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; I
wunnot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got up and went out of the room, slamming the door behind
him.&nbsp; Jinny was nonplussed for once; but nevertheless,
following her elementary <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>mode of procedure, prepared such an
appetising breakfast on the following morning, as she hoped would
touch the heart of even the most hardened sinner.&nbsp; Luke,
however, did not put himself in the way of being softened; he
rose even earlier than his landlady; dressed himself sullenly in
his working-clothes, and went off for a solitary ramble along the
shore.</p>
<p>The Rector met Miss Whiteside on her way to church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, only one companion!&rdquo; he cried,
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one, sir,&rdquo; said Jinny, dropping a staid
curtsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&nbsp; I thought there were no black sheep
in your fold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step a bit up the road, John, do,&rdquo; remarked Jinny
in a loud aside; as soon as this injunction had been obeyed, she
turned to the Rector.&nbsp; &ldquo;I doubt my new lodger&rsquo;s
a black &rsquo;un&mdash;leastways not altogether black.&nbsp; He
keeps all my rules nobbut this &rsquo;un.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ve
dropped beer an&rsquo; bad words, an&rsquo; he says his prayers
an&rsquo; grace an&rsquo; all, an&rsquo; he comes a-whoam by
ten&mdash;but he says &rsquo;tis his rule not to go to
church&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how to mak&rsquo; &rsquo;un do
it, that&rsquo;s the worst on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve mended
all his clothes this week so I can&rsquo;t get even wi&rsquo; un
wi&rsquo; leavin&rsquo; &rsquo;em in holes.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t
have no breakfast this mornin&rsquo; but I can&rsquo;t go on
cuttin&rsquo; off his victuals for long.&nbsp; The mon works
&rsquo;ard, an&rsquo; wants &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rector laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever tried persuasion?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sometimes when threats fail coaxing prevails.&nbsp; He
can&rsquo;t be a bad fellow if he does all you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t say he was bad,&rdquo; she
agreed <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>meditatively.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never thought o&rsquo;
tryin&rsquo; persuasion,&rdquo; she added.&nbsp; &ldquo;My way is
to serve &rsquo;em out if they don&rsquo;t do what I tell
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rector laughed again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A spoonful of honey catches more flies than a
pint of vinegar&rsquo;,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;have you ever
heard that saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny had not, but conceded that it met be true enough; she
followed John with a pensive look.</p>
<p>Kershaw did not return for dinner, nor yet for tea; he did
not, in fact, put in an appearance until late in the evening,
when, if truth be told, he was considerably the worse for
drink.&nbsp; He went straight upstairs to bed without pausing a
moment in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Next morning, when he came in for his breakfast, this being
his week for early duty at the station, he expected a severe
lecture, but Jinny set his food before him with a pleasant
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; growled Luke sarcastically,
&ldquo;yo&rsquo;ll gie me summat to eat to-day, will
yo&rsquo;?&nbsp; Well, I can do wi&rsquo; a bit at after
yesterday.&nbsp; Bread and cheese were my dinner yesterday.&nbsp;
I had to walk nigh upon six mile afore I could get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;r dinner was waitin&rsquo; for yo&rsquo;
here,&rdquo; responded Jinny, with mild dignity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas keepin&rsquo; hot for yo&rsquo; all the
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought haply yo&rsquo; was goin&rsquo; to punish me
by makin&rsquo; me clem all day.&nbsp; Yo&rsquo; was some mad
wi&rsquo; me, wasn&rsquo;t yo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; replied Jinny, still mildly,
&ldquo;not mad.&nbsp; I were nobbut sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that week she redoubled her attentions to <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>Luke, and
when Saturday night came he was astonished and abashed when she
put a little parcel into his hands.&nbsp; It contained a tie of
the brightest hues and the richest texture obtainable for a
shilling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If yo&rsquo;ll weer that to-morrow, Luke,&rdquo; she
said graciously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel proper proud
steppin&rsquo; along aside of yo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke gazed hesitatingly, first at the tie, then at
Jinny&rsquo;s beaming face; then folding up the little packet he
tendered it back to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tak&rsquo; it on false
pertences,&rdquo; he faltered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no
church-goer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny swallowed down what appeared to be a lump in her
throat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep it all the same, an&rsquo; weer it
to-morrow,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s one thing
yo&rsquo; can do.&nbsp; Yo&rsquo;ll not ha&rsquo; no objections
to waitin&rsquo; outside the gate for me, an&rsquo; walkin&rsquo;
home along of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke eyed her suspiciously, but consented after a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, reflecting that she could not possibly
force him to go in.</p>
<p>He duly sat on the wall outside the church on the following
day, and escorted Miss Whiteside home, feeling somewhat ashamed
of himself, as he noted her chastened air and heard the heavy
sigh which now and then escaped from her.</p>
<p>That afternoon, however, her continued affability emboldened
him to make a request on his own account.&nbsp; It was such a
lovely day, and he was free&mdash;would not Miss Whiteside go for
a walk with him?&nbsp; Jinny, startled, began to refuse with her
usual abruptness, but checked herself midway, and consented
instead.</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>They
strolled out together along a narrow path, which led past meadows
and cornfields to a little wood.&nbsp; While they sat there,
resting on a mossy bank, the church bells began to ring, now on
one side of them, now on the other.&nbsp; Luke glanced
sarcastically at his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon yo&rsquo;re wishin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;rself theer
an&rsquo; not here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny looked up with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheer?&rdquo; she asked, and turned very red.&nbsp;
Luke stared, laughed, and then suddenly grew serious, blushing
too.&nbsp; Silence reigned for a moment and then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt I&rsquo;d best tell yo&rsquo; why I&rsquo;m so
set again church-goin&rsquo;.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
altogether along o&rsquo; not wishin&rsquo; to be put upon.&nbsp;
When I were a young chap a parson comed between me an&rsquo; the
lass I were a-coortin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; said Jinny distantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, he did.&nbsp; She was a sarvent lass an&rsquo;
couldn&rsquo;t get out above once a fortnight.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t see so mich on her I could afford to lose the time
she spent in church, and parson he barged at her for not
goin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Well, I geet my back set up along of it,
an&rsquo; I towd her one day she mun mind me an&rsquo; not
parson.&nbsp; Well she wouldn&rsquo;t, so I gave up
a-walkin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; her, an&rsquo; she took up wi&rsquo;
another chap, an&rsquo; I promised mysel&rsquo; I&rsquo;d never
go to church again as long as I lived&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
kept my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if yo&rsquo;ll excuse me, I think yo&rsquo;re
nothing but a noddy!&rdquo; cried Jinny, with decidedly more
vinegar than honey in her tone.&nbsp; She sprang to her feet,
shaking out her dress.</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>&ldquo;I doubt I will go to church arter all,&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, a promise is a promise,&rdquo; returned Luke,
catching her by the arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit yo&rsquo; down again,
an&rsquo; tell me why yo&rsquo; reckon I&rsquo;m a
noddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a body can&rsquo;t think it anything but foolish
to go on a-keepin&rsquo; up spite along of a wench same&rsquo;s
that,&rdquo; cried she, twitching away her arm, but making no
further effort to leave him.&nbsp; &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t be
worth mich if she could go takin&rsquo; up wi&rsquo; another chap
so quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; agreed Luke.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
was in a hurry to forget me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She mun ha&rsquo; been a leet-minded snicket not worth
frettin&rsquo; arter,&rdquo; pursued Jinny warmly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An&rsquo; she can&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; had a bit o&rsquo;
sperrit neither.&nbsp; She ought to ha&rsquo; stood up to
yo&rsquo; an&rsquo; showed yo&rsquo; yo&rsquo; was doin&rsquo;
her no harm an&rsquo; yo&rsquo;rself no good.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d
ha&rsquo; bin in her shoes&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She stopped short,
colouring again to the roots of her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set yo&rsquo; down again, do,&rdquo; said Luke
persuasively.&nbsp; &ldquo;What &rsquo;ud yo&rsquo; ha&rsquo;
done if yo&rsquo;d been in her shoes, Jinny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny sat down, but for once in her life was dumbfounded; she
did not dare raise her eyes to Luke&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s no knowin&rsquo; what yo&rsquo; met
ha&rsquo; done wi&rsquo; me if yo&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; bin in
Mary&rsquo;s shoes,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yo&rsquo;ve a
wonderful manageable way wi&rsquo; yo&rsquo;, Miss
Whiteside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem able to manage yo&rsquo;
though,&rdquo; said Jinny inconsequently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had lodgers, a-mony of &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve took a
interest in &rsquo;em all, an&rsquo; they allus did what I
wanted&mdash;all of &rsquo;em, nobbut yo&rsquo;.&nbsp;
Yo&rsquo;re <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>the first as ever refused to do what I axed
yo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coom,&rdquo; cried Luke indignantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve gived in to yo&rsquo;
more&rsquo;n I&rsquo;ve ever gived in to a wumman before.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve done all as yo&rsquo; axed me&mdash;nay, yo&rsquo;
didn&rsquo;t ax me, yo&rsquo; ordered me, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not
one as likes to be ordered by a wumman&mdash;but I gived in all
but the one thing&mdash;I&rsquo;ve gived yo&rsquo; my rayson for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t no rayson at all,&rdquo; said
Jinny.&nbsp; &ldquo;Coom now, Luke, yo&rsquo; owned up to me
about that a minute ago.&nbsp; Coom, I&rsquo;ll not order
yo&rsquo; no more&mdash;I&rsquo;ll ax yo&rsquo;
gradely&mdash;happen yo&rsquo;ll do it if I ax yo&rsquo;
proper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her blue eyes were shining with eagerness, her lips were
parted with an arch smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happen I would,&rdquo; admitted Luke.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear yo&rsquo; do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then Luke, ha&rsquo; done wi&rsquo;
foolishness,&rdquo; she said in her most persuasive tones.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Promise yo&rsquo;ll coom to church same as any other
Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not axin&rsquo; me proper,&rdquo; said
Luke.&nbsp; &ldquo;I care nowt at all about any other
Christian.&nbsp; Say it this way, Jinny&mdash;&lsquo;Will
yo&rsquo; coom to church wi&rsquo; me?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will yo&rsquo; coom to church,&rdquo; she began
falteringly, and then broke off for Luke had seized her
hand&mdash;&ldquo;Whativer are yo&rsquo; drivin&rsquo;
at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theer, I&rsquo;ll ax the question mysel&rsquo;,&rdquo;
cried Luke.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will <i>yo&rsquo;</i> go to church
wi&rsquo; <i>me</i>, Jinny?&nbsp; If yo&rsquo;ll gie me your
promise, I&rsquo;ll walk i&rsquo; your footsteps all my days, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinny presumably gave her promise, for when they presently
emerged from the wood they were <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>walking arm-in-arm.&nbsp; Whether he
subsequently fulfilled his resolve of following meekly in her
footsteps, is a moot point, for Luke was a person of strong
individuality; but Jinny liked him none the less for that, and
one thing is certain: she saw to it that he kept the rules of the
house.</p>
<h2><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>LADY
LUCY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">John Cotley</span> closed his
account-book&mdash;blotting the last entry carefully, for he was
an orderly man&mdash;and laid it in its accustomed place in the
drawer of his high desk.&nbsp; Then, rising from the tall stool
on which he had been seated for an hour and more, he passed his
hands across his brow, and looked through the mullioned window at
the fast darkening landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It grows late,&rdquo; quoth he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Molly will
be in a taking at my keeping supper waiting so long, but I must
stretch my legs first, after all this sitting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he stood in the wainscotted hall without, in the act of
taking down his hat, he was startled by loud rapping at the great
wooden gates of the yard, which had been closed and bolted for
the night, together with the sound of several voices raised in
unison.&nbsp; He threw open the hall-door and stood for a moment
on the threshold, listening; and the rapping was repeated, and
the voices called&mdash;some gruffly and some shrilly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us in&mdash;you there!&nbsp; Let us in!&nbsp; What,
is everyone in the place dead or deaf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John went slowly down the flagged path between the lavender
hedges, and began with a grating, grinding sound to draw back the
heavy bolts, the voices on the other side of the stout oak
portals keeping up, meanwhile, a running commentary of <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>impatient
ejaculations, intermingled with little bursts of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, good fellow, who ever you may be, put a little
goodwill into your efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie! what a disagreeable noise!&nbsp; Sir, &rsquo;tis
to be wished that your master would expend a pennyworth of oil on
this screeching ironwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;La! what a time the rascal takes!&nbsp; Pray, Hodge, or
Giles, or whatever thy name may be, tell us who lives here.&nbsp;
We had thought you deaf; and now, faith, it would seem as if you
were dumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Tufty, do not distract the poor yokel.&nbsp; These
rustics have not wit enough to attend to more than one thing at a
time.&nbsp; Tug away at thy bolt, good man, and let us in; it
grows chilly here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length, with a final shriek, the last bolt was withdrawn
from its rusty hasp, and the doors parted in the middle under
John&rsquo;s hand; then, removing his round hat, he was
preparing, with his usual gravity, to enquire the reason of this
unexpected visit, when, with many expressions of relief and
satisfaction, a party of what seemed to be very grand folk
brushed past him into the enclosure.&nbsp; There was a rustling
of silken skirts, a waving of long feathers&mdash;a diffusion of
sweet strange odours&mdash;such odours as had never yet greeted
the honest country nostrils of John Cotley, though they would
have been familiar enough to any frequenter of high company in
town; odours of powder and pomatum, and the scented bags that
women of fashion lay among their tuckers.&nbsp; Thus the ladies
filed past, one, two, and three; and then the gentlemen <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>came&mdash;very fine gentlemen, indeed.&nbsp; John
could see, even in the dim light, the glitter of gold lace and
sparkling buckles, the pale gleam of silk-stockinged legs and
powdered heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La, how sweet it smells,&rdquo; cried one of the
ladies.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; Roses, think
you&mdash;gilly-flowers?&nbsp; Nay, &rsquo;tis lavender!&nbsp;
See these ghostly hedges are all of lavender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; cried one of the gallants,
&ldquo;&rsquo;twould please me better could I smell some savoury
stew.&nbsp; Ghostly, did you say?&nbsp; I vow the whole place
looks ghostly.&nbsp; Not a light in all those ancient
windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, you there, you, fellow; leave the gate and try
and find thy tongue.&nbsp; Does anybody live here, and is it
possible to obtain refreshment and a night&rsquo;s
lodging?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live here,&rdquo; said John, somewhat ruffled by the
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to your second question, before answering
it I will first ask one or two of my own.&nbsp; What may this
company be, and why do they seek admittance into my house at such
an hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what a churl is this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gad, &rsquo;tis his house, Harry.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
been discussing the place in the presence of its owner; but we
must needs be civil, it seems, if we would dine and sleep under
cover.&nbsp; Sir, you behold a noble company of travellers, or,
if you prefer it, a travelling company of noblemen and ladies,
journeying from Bristol Hotwells, where they have been sojourning
for the good of their health.&nbsp; Their coach, having taken a
wrong turn, has inconveniently broken down on that abominable
mixture of marsh <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>and stones which you are pleased in these parts to term
a road.&nbsp; As it is late and the ladies are hungry and tired,
the gentlemen athirst, the best horse lame, the front wheel
damaged, and the postboy drunk, we deem it better to push no
further to-night.&nbsp; Therefore, finding no inn within a radius
of ten miles, and descrying your house&mdash;which seemed to us a
building of some importance&mdash;we have come to throw ourselves
upon your hospitality for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; returned John simply, &ldquo;I am sorry for
your misfortune, and will do my best to entertain you, though,
being a plain man and a bachelor, I fear the accommodation I can
offer you is not such as these ladies are accustomed
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said, man! you can but do your best,&rdquo; cried
the gentleman called Harry, clapping John on his brawny
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, lead the way, and we&rsquo;ll all
promise not to be over fastidious.&nbsp; Something to
drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John led the way into the house, baring his head as he passed
the ladies, and the party trooped after him into a panelled
parlour, where the dim outlines of cumbrous articles of furniture
might be discerned in the dusk.&nbsp; Drawing a tinder-box from
his pocket, he struck a light, and having ignited the candles on
the mantelshelf, turned to face his visitors.</p>
<p>The flickering light revealed to them the sunburnt face and
well-knit figure of a man of about five-and-twenty, with brown
hair and brown eyes, and an expression of shy kindliness.</p>
<p>As he looked in bewilderment from one to the <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>other of
his guests, dazzled by the medley of fine clothes and trinkets,
here marking the gleam of white teeth, there a pair of dancing
eyes, yonder the flutter of powdered locks, out of the confusion
there seemed to detach itself&mdash;one face.&nbsp; A small face,
round which the hair fell in natural curls untouched by powder;
laughing eyes, a mouth at once sweet and roguish; a bloom that
even John&rsquo;s unsophisticated eyes instantly recognised as
being wholly natural, yet such as he had never beheld on the
solid cheeks of the rustic damsels of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Forgetful of his good manners, Cotley stared mutely at this
lovely face, until recalled to himself by a murmur of amusement
from the rest of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have recovered your tongue, mine host, we
shall be glad if you will introduce yourself,&rdquo; remarked one
of the gentlemen.&nbsp; &ldquo;I myself must own to no little
curiosity about you.&nbsp; Pray, man, are you a hermit, that you
live thus in what seems to be absolute solitude?&nbsp; Split me,
if I&rsquo;ve seen a living soul about the place except
yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; returned the other, with a start and a
blush, &ldquo;my name is John Cotley, at your service.&nbsp; I
am, as I think is easily seen, a gentleman of somewhat limited
means.&nbsp; Had you come before sundown you might have observed
a few of my labourers busy on the premises&mdash;when they leave,
I own, with the exception of my old housekeeper, I am alone in
the house.&rdquo;&nbsp; Looking round on the curious and
surprised faces he added, stiffly, with a certain boyish pride:
&ldquo;My family met with reverses before <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>I succeeded
to this small estate, and, if I am to live here at all, I must
perforce practise great economy and see but little
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said a soft voice, which was not
meant to reach his ears; but John heard nevertheless, and marked
that the bright eyes of the youthful beauty were fixed on him
with an expression at once of interest and compassion.</p>
<p>But the others were not so considerate&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Economy!&rdquo; quoth Tufty, with a grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Harry earnestly, &ldquo;you have my
sympathy, but I trust for all our sakes that there is at least
some drinkable beer to be had on your premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or at any rate a dish of tea,&rdquo; put in one of the
elder ladies.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, sir, let the matter have your
attention, for I assure you we are positively faint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A roast fowl would not come amiss,&rdquo; added the
other matron, whose appearance was indeed suggestive of
good-living, for her large person seemed to be bursting out of
her silk sacque, and her face was as plump as it was
good-humoured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such a thing should easy be come by
in the country&mdash;a platter of ham and eggs with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, looking almost beseechingly at her bewildered
entertainer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speed, sir,&rdquo; chimed in Tufty,
&ldquo;speed&mdash;despatch for heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sirs,&mdash;ladies, I go at once,&rdquo; cried John,
starting towards the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Meanwhile be seated, I
beg.&nbsp; I regret with all my heart I have no good
entertainment to offer you, but I will do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hastened from the room, shouting lustily for <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>&ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; and, after what seemed to the
impatient guests an interminable delay, the heavy door was thrown
open, and an old woman entered, carrying a tablecloth.&nbsp; The
master of the house followed, bearing a tray, on which, in the
midst of a shining array of plates and glasses, knives and forks,
a toby jug of goodly proportions occupied the place of
honour.&nbsp; They proceeded, awkwardly enough, to lay the table,
and the housekeeper, having retired, presently returned,
staggering under the weight of another huge tray, on which were
set forth such homely viands as the house could provide: a round
of cold salt beef, a crusty loaf, a dish of ham and eggs.&nbsp;
When all was set upon the table John stood hesitating a moment,
and then going straight up to the owner of the unpowdered curls
begged leave to hand her to a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Fore George, the manners of these country
bumpkins want mending as well as their gates!&rdquo; cried
Tufty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir, do you not see that Her Grace is yet
standing?&rdquo; and he waved his hand in the direction of the
stout lady already alluded to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her Grace!&rdquo; stammered John, somewhat taken aback,
and then he added bluntly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, I will come back for you so soon as I have
conducted this lady to the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; returned she, with a jolly laugh,
&ldquo;I protest I like your unceremoniousness.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
a refreshing change.&nbsp; And after all you could not be
expected to divine my quality.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not often, I
wager, that you entertain a Duchess in this solitary
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; responded John gravely, &ldquo;I must own
that I have never before been privileged to offer hospitality <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>to persons
of such consequence; but I can truthfully say that my desire to
serve you is not more ardent than before my knowledge of your
station.&nbsp; I would fain do all in my power to succour and
entertain any lady in distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very prettily said,&rdquo; returned she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, my good sir, we will dispense with ceremony for
to-night.&nbsp; Pray sit by Lady Lucy since your unbiassed choice
has fallen on her.&nbsp; My friend, Lord Tuftington, will escort
me; and you, Lady Olivia, will no doubt allow Sir Harry to be
your companion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, madam, so that we may at once attack that round
of beef, I have no objection to make,&rdquo; responded Lady
Olivia, hurrying towards the board.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Molly stood gaping, and John himself was a little
taken aback on hearing of the exalted rank of all his
self-invited guests.&nbsp; Yet, with a certain natural dignity,
he took his place as master of the house, and proceeded to
dispense hospitality.</p>
<p>He soon found, indeed, that these noble folks were as affable
in manner as gay in humour.&nbsp; Sir Harry proceeded to pour out
foaming beakers of ale for as many of the company as desired to
partake of it; and, somewhat to John&rsquo;s surprise, everyone
with the exception of Lady Lucy accepted this homely beverage;
even Her Grace the Duchess quaffed her tumbler with unfeigned
approval.&nbsp; Lord Tuftington served the ham and eggs, and Lady
Olivia, with great good-humour and a firm hand, cut slices from
the crusty loaf which she laughingly tossed across the table to
each member of the party.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lady Lucy sat toying with an egg, speaking little,
though every now and then her face <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>lit up with smiles over some
ridiculous sally from Tufty or Sir Harry.&nbsp; Once or twice
John caught a curious glance shot at him from beneath her long
curling dark lashes, and with each of them he felt as though that
manly heart of his, hitherto untouched by love for woman, were
being drawn from out his bosom.&nbsp; Fain would he have sat by
her side in mute ecstacy, but his guests plied him incessantly
with questions, and appeared to be excessively diverted by the
simplicity of his answers.</p>
<p>All at once the Duchess threw down her knife and fork with a
little scream&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;we have left that booby
of a postboy to his own devices.&nbsp; What if he should have
made off with all our property!&nbsp; Quick, somebody, see to
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Duchess,&rdquo; returned Tufty, with his mouth
full, &ldquo;the fellow was dead drunk, and the best horse dead
lame&mdash;they will stick in the mud safe enough till
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely our valises should be brought in?&rdquo;
cried Lady Olivia.&nbsp; &ldquo;If by any accident the fellow
should abscond, we shall arrive in town without so much as a
change of linen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, we are all in the like plight,&rdquo; observed
Sir Harry; &ldquo;and in any case, if the lad had given us the
slip he would be miles away by now, and it would be useless to
pursue him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot, I am sure, be serious,&rdquo; said Lady
Lucy, looking from one to the other with large, startled
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would not be so inhuman as to leave the
poor man exposed to the weather <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>all night.&nbsp; And the
horses&mdash;think of the horses.&nbsp; Surely they too need food
and shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of the gentlemen seemed in the least touched by her
appeal, and, though the Duchess and Lady Olivia continued loud
protestations and entreaties, both Sir Harry and Lord Tuftington
continued their repast without offering to move.</p>
<p>John looked from one to the other of these worthies with
astonished disapproval.&nbsp; Indeed, from the first, both
gentlemen had impressed him unfavourably.&nbsp; Their voices were
loud, their laughter excessive: Lord Tuftington interlarded his
conversations with strange expletives, while Sir Harry helped
himself perpetually from the beer-jug.&nbsp; He was surprised to
observe on nearer view that the latter&rsquo;s dress was at once
tawdry and slovenly; his gold lace was tarnished, his ruffles
soiled; as he held the jug aloft on one occasion, John actually
detected a rent in his fine peach-coloured coat.</p>
<p>After a pause, broken only by the lamentations of the elder
ladies, Lucy turned hesitatingly to her host&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not think, sir,&rdquo; she said pathetically,
&ldquo;that it is cruel to leave the poor horses standing in the
road all night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried John, starting up,
&ldquo;with your leave I will at once go and see after
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And bring my valise, good sir,&rdquo; besought Lady
Olivia&mdash;&ldquo;the smallest valise in the boot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, Mr Cotley, try to bring all our
property&mdash;all at least that is portable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, ladies,&rdquo; returned John, &ldquo;I shall
be happy to carry some of the baggage myself, and <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>to direct
your servant to bring the remainder hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am obliged to you, sir,&rdquo; replied the Duchess,
with a somewhat embarrassed air, &ldquo;but you must know that
with the exception of the postboy we are unattended at
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a pity, indeed, my dear,&rdquo; put in Lady
Olivia, &ldquo;that we should have left all our servants
behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, ladies, remember,&rdquo; put in Sir Harry, with
half-tipsy gravity, &ldquo;that we are travelling
incog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the postboy may help me,&rdquo; said John.</p>
<p>When he reached the scene of the catastrophe, however, he
found the fellow so hopelessly intoxicated, that it was clear no
help was to be expected from him, and he was forced to seek
assistance from some of his own work-people who lived in a little
hamlet about a mile from his house.&nbsp; It was more than an
hour, therefore, before he returned home, himself leading the
horses, while a couple of stout lads staggered in his wake laden
with the ladies&rsquo; luggage, the post-boy having by his
directions been lifted inside the empty vehicle, which had been
drawn up under the hedge for the night.</p>
<p>He found the parlour empty, save for Sir Harry, who lay
stretched half across the table, while upstairs all was merry
bustle.&nbsp; Old Molly was distractedly hastening from one room
to another with her warming-pan, while Lord Tuftington stalked
behind her, laden with warm blankets and piles of lavender
scented sheets.&nbsp; The ladies had volunteered to make the
beds, and with much chatter and <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>laughter the work proceeded.&nbsp;
They often changed their minds with regard to the apartment which
each intended to occupy, and the trunks were in consequence
dragged from room to room; some half unpacked disgorging their
finery in the passage&mdash;in fact such a scene of confusion had
never before been witnessed within the quiet walls of Cotley
Grange.</p>
<p>But at last some measure of order was restored: the babel of
voices and laughter ceased; the last door banged for the last
time: the last light was extinguished, and by-and-by all the
house was still.</p>
<p>John, too, retired to bed, but only to toss feverishly from
side to side, with throbbing head and leaping pulses.&nbsp; Now
he would thrill with delight as he recalled the kind look which
Lady Lucy had cast upon him when he bade her good night: now a
pang of despair would pierce his very soul as he thought of how
she would leave on the morrow, and of how, in all probability, he
would never set eyes on her again.</p>
<p>He rose with dawn and went out of doors; his men would soon
arrive, but, before allotting them their daily tasks, he sought
to regain some measure of his usual composure.&nbsp; Pacing up
and down the garden at the rear of the house&mdash;if in truth
the sweet wilderness of tangled greenery and lush grass, and
borders where flowers and weed embraced each other might be
dignified with such a name&mdash;he inhaled the pure chill air of
the September morning, throwing open coat and waistcoat as though
the fresh blast could allay the fever in his breast.&nbsp; The <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>swallows
were already on the wing, now circling aloft against the pearly
sky, now dipping until they appeared to brush the dewy grass; a
robin was piping on a lichened apple-bough, and to poor John
Cotley the sweet shrill notes seemed to carry a message at once
poignant and delightful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did she come here!&rdquo; he groaned; and in
another moment he was asking himself distractedly how he had
contrived to exist before seeing her.</p>
<p>The sun had not yet risen high in the heavens, and the dew
still lay in silver sheets upon the meads, when Lady Lucy, having
left her chamber, was minded to take to take a walk abroad.&nbsp;
She had protected her head with a scarf which was lifted by the
strong autumn breeze, so that its fringes and her clustering
curls were alike set dancing; and she had thrust her little feet
into thin slippers with very high heels, most unfit for the
wanderings on which she was bent; but nevertheless, having first
tripped down the flagged path between the lavender hedges, and
found the gates still closed, she had stolen up the weed-grown
track that led round the house, and made her way through the
shrubberies, laughing as the wet leaves flapped in her face, and
peering round her with curious delighted eyes.&nbsp; And
suddenly, pushing through an overgrown arch of yew and holly that
had once been clipped into fantastic shapes, she came face to
face with John Cotley, standing stock-still in the middle of the
alley, with one hand pressed to his brow and the other clutching
at his bosom.&nbsp; Then what must Lady Lucy do on her perceiving
the young man&rsquo;s violent start and <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>blush, but
burst into the sweetest, gayest little trill of laughter, while
poor John first reddened to the roots of his disordered hair, and
then grew pale as death, and drew his coat and waistcoat together
hastily, and stammered at last as she laughed on&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, I crave your pardon&mdash;I&mdash;I humbly crave
your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what, my good sir?&rdquo; cried she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For taking a morning stroll in your own grounds, or for
being discovered in such a profound reverie?&nbsp; Nay, sir, it
is rather I who should ask pardon for breaking in so suddenly on
what seemed to be very serious reflections, and for laughing so
rudely.&nbsp; But I vow it was droll and unexpected to find you
could assume so tragic an air&mdash;and then your
start&mdash;your look of surprise!&nbsp; Pray, sir, did you think
I had fallen from the clouds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John blushed again, and, finding that she continued to look
upon him smilingly and very kindly, took courage, and said
gently&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas folly in me to appear surprised, madam, for
I believe that angels do sometimes descend from the
clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vastly well, sir,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray
where did you learn to pay compliments?&nbsp; I had thought they
were not easily come by in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, madam,&rdquo; sighed poor John, ruefully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I fear I should prove a poor scholar were I to attempt to
learn the art of flattery.&nbsp; In saying that you appear to me
to be an angel I did but speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Lucy stopped laughing, and hung down <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>her head in
a manner quite inexplicable to John Cotley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An angel!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, sir, what
do you know of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what my eyes have shown me, madam,&rdquo; said
John, and then emboldened by a certain timid protest in her
downcast face, he added warmly, &ldquo;only what my heart has
told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in some unaccountable fashion John Cotley&rsquo;s tongue
was loosed, and he found himself telling Lady Lucy all manner of
strange things.&nbsp; About his loneliness, and of how during his
somewhat melancholy life he had never hitherto met with a woman
whom he could love; of how at first sight of her he had fallen a
victim to one of those sudden passions of which he had sometimes
heard, but in which he had never hitherto believed; of how
absolutely hopeless he knew it to be, what misery, and yet what
joy.&nbsp; His face glowed as he spoke, and his eyes were bright
with a kind of fierce triumph: she should hear, she should
know&mdash;at least she should know.</p>
<p>Her colour came and went as she listened; now her eyes were
drawn to John&rsquo;s, as though fascinated, now they sought the
ground; once or twice she caught her breath with a little
gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a few moments ago,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;I was
telling myself that I wished I had never seen you; and now,
though I may never see you again, I thank Heaven that this hour
at least is mine.&nbsp; One hour, madam, out of a lifetime; it is
not much, but at least it is something to look back
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To look back on,&rdquo; she repeated, with an odd <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>expression,
and an attempt at lightness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely, sir, it is
better to look forward.&nbsp; I, for one, care not for giving way
to gloomy thoughts.&nbsp; The whole world lies before us.&nbsp;
I, you must know, am about to be introduced to it for the first
time: why should not you, too, seek to make a figure in it?&nbsp;
Why bury yourself for ever in this solitude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, madam,&rdquo; cried John excitedly, &ldquo;would
you have me seek my fortune in London?&nbsp; Oh, if I thought
there were the slightest hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, good friend, I spoke not of hope,&rdquo; returned
she; &ldquo;our ways, as you very truly say, lie apart, and
perhaps it is better so; were you to meet me in town, you might
think more lowly of me than you do at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could that be?&rdquo; he exclaimed eagerly, adding,
however, despondently, &ldquo;but it is folly for me even to talk
of such a thing.&nbsp; How could I, plain John Cotley, the
unpretending country gentleman, with threadbare clothes and light
purse, hope to make my way into the circles which you will
adorn.&nbsp; You, who will be courted by the highest in the land,
admired by all the fashionable world.&nbsp; Dukes, I
suppose,&rdquo; cried the poor fellow, gloomily, &ldquo;Dukes and
Marquises will be fighting for the privilege of kissing your
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; she rejoined, with a careless shrug,
&ldquo;there will be plenty of that, I dare say.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then, seeing his melancholy face, she added with an arch
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;But London is a large place, so large that
even besides the fashionable folk of whom you speak there might
be room for honest John Cotley.&nbsp; And what though there be a
whole horde of noble <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>admirers coming to Court and applaud
me!&nbsp; Is a worthy country gentleman for that obliged to hold
aloof?&nbsp; Sir, I tell you in the great world of London there
are many places where a man may see the object of his
admiration.&nbsp; There are, to begin with, places of
entertainment, such as Vauxhall, Ranelagh, and the like, and then
there are the playhouses.&nbsp; Now, as a matter of fact, did you
chance to be at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells Theatre on this day
se&rsquo;en-night you would see me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a playhouse!&rdquo; cried simple John, all in a
turmoil of emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madam, I have never been at such
a place in my life.&nbsp; My parents held that play-going was
folly, if not worse, and indeed even were I so minded I have had
no opportunities of frequenting such resorts.&nbsp; But to see
you&mdash;if I thought there were a hope of seeing
you&mdash;&nbsp; But no, you are mocking me.&nbsp; Even if I were
to go there, how should I venture to intrude my company upon
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are faint-hearted, in fact,&rdquo; said she, while
a wicked little dimple came and went about her lips, &ldquo;and
you remember the adage, &lsquo;Faint
heart&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>John looked at her bewildered, enraptured, and
mystified.&nbsp; Her words appeared to encourage what had seemed
to him a perfectly wild and preposterous hope, but her manner was
at once gay and repellent.&nbsp; As he stood earnestly
considering her in the endeavour to fathom her meaning, she
ceased laughing, and fixed her eyes upon him with a gaze that was
serious and almost sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I speak foolishly.&nbsp;
Do not come to town, Mr Cotley; better remain here in your
tranquil and solitary home, and think upon me sometimes <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>kindly.&nbsp; Think of this hour, an hour that is all
peace and innocence and brightness.&nbsp; Come, shall we
walk?&nbsp; I have a mind to explore these alleys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew her scarf more closely round her, and looked about
her, her face bright with a child&rsquo;s curiosity and pleasure,
her momentary gravity forgotten.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, the
roses,&rdquo; she cried, and clapped her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
those sober old gilly-flowers, how sweet they are.&nbsp; And what
a forest of Michaelmas daisies!&nbsp; Pray, Mr Cotley, will you
gather me a posy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is needless to say how eagerly John fulfilled her behest,
and with what a distracting mixture of pleasure and longing he
saw her fasten the flowers at her waist.</p>
<p>Slowly they paced about the moss-grown paths.&nbsp; Once she
stumbled, and he enquired breathlessly if she would take his
arm.&nbsp; What wondering bliss when she agreed; how that strong
arm of his thrilled under the light pressure!&nbsp; What a sweet,
sweet, brief dream it was!&nbsp; All too brief, indeed, for while
they yet wandered side by side among the sunlit green a shrill
voice was heard calling from the house, and Lucy, withdrawing her
hand from his arm, gave a little impatient sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are calling me; I must go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; cried John peremptorily; his
voice was hoarse, his eyes seemed to burn in his pale face,
&ldquo;let us part here, since we must part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She, too, had grown pale; but, after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
seemed to struggle against the contagion of his emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh,&rdquo; she said, with a little jarring note in
her <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>voice, &ldquo;who knows?&nbsp; After all we may meet
yet.&nbsp; Some folks say the world is a small place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he cried fiercely, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
you, yourself, who have said it, madam.&nbsp; You go out of my
life this day; my one hour is wellnigh over, but a moment of it
remains.&nbsp; Let it at least be full; give me something to
remember it by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trembling in spite of herself, she looked at him, as much in
earnest now as he:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have?&rdquo; she said almost in a
whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;This?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She detached one of the roses from her nosegay and held it out
to him with shaking fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have more, madam,&rdquo; he cried, and,
bending, took both her hands in his and kissed them many times
with a vehemence which startled her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said, and her slight form wavered
like a reed, &ldquo;good-bye, poor John, dear John, try to think
well of me always.&nbsp; And now, let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But John had fallen on his knees in the green bower, and his
face, as he uplifted it, seemed bright with a kind of white
radiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, love,&rdquo; he cried in a broken whisper,
&ldquo;love, stoop to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew her gently towards him, and she did not resist, and
they kissed each other shyly, tenderly, wonderingly, as the first
man and woman may have kissed beneath the blossoming trees of
Eden.</p>
<p>Then the shrill cry came nearer, and there was a sound of
pattering feet, and in a moment she was gone, and John Cotley was
left alone to awake from his dream.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>One
week after the events which had so disturbed the placid current
of John Cotley&rsquo;s life, that unwise young gentleman might
have been discerned making his way into Sadler&rsquo;s Wells
Play-house amid a crowd of more seasoned play-goers.</p>
<p>He had struggled fruitlessly against the overpowering desire
to see Lady Lucy again; everything indeed had seemed to point out
the folly of his enterprise; the prejudices of a lifetime, the
oft-repeated axioms of those whom he had loved and lost, his own
diffidence, the absolute hopelessness of his passion, but none of
these considerations had been strong enough to outweigh the
memory of the girl&rsquo;s tantalising words: &ldquo;Did you
chance to be at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells Playhouse on this day
se&rsquo;en-night you would see me there!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then
again, &ldquo;You remember the adage, &lsquo;Faint
heart&rsquo;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely no one could say that John Cotley&rsquo;s heart was
faint this evening; on the contrary, it beat so loud and strong
that he wondered his neighbours did not turn to look at
him.&nbsp; When he entered the building and took his seat the
whole place seemed to swim round him, and the play-bill fluttered
in his hand.&nbsp; But by-and-by he began to regain his
self-possession; the lights which had danced before his gaze
settled steadily in their places, and he took courage to rise and
cast a searching glance round the house; but strain his eyes as
he might he could not discover Lady Lucy.&nbsp; The house,
indeed, seemed packed from pit to topmost gallery, but amidst all
the rows and rows of faces hers was missing.&nbsp; After
concluding his futile search for the twentieth time <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>he sat down
disconsolately, and, to hide his confusion on perceiving the
amused and curious stare of his neighbours, he fell to examining
his play-bill.&nbsp; At first the words floated meaninglessly
before his eyes, but by-and-by one of them took shape and
assumed, indeed, an odd familiarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Lord Tuftington</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Lord
Tuftington</i>!&nbsp; Why, surely that was the name of one of the
invaders of Cotley Grange on that never-to-be-forgotten
evening.&nbsp; Lord Tuftington!&nbsp; How did his name come to be
there?&nbsp; But stop!&nbsp; Here was another that he knew,
&ldquo;<i>Sir Harry Highflyer</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here again,
&ldquo;<i>The Duchess of Flummery</i>,&rdquo; and again,
&ldquo;<i>Lady Olivia Pouncebox</i>,&rdquo; and here&mdash;here
actually was the name of all others sacred to him, &ldquo;<i>Lady
Lucy Mayflower</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Lady Lucy</i>!</p>
<p>He sat staring at the paper for a moment, and then, scarce
knowing what he did, turned to one of his neighbours&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, sir, is it not a strange thing for such a noble
company to give a performance in a public place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stared, and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I fail to understand you.&nbsp; Where, in
heaven&rsquo;s name, would you have them perform if not in a
public place?&nbsp; How else should we see them play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for charity, no doubt,&rdquo; cried John,
scarcely heeding him, and speaking in a white heat of passionate
indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;But to me it seems degrading that they
should thus expose themselves, so that all who pay a certain
price are free to gape at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>The
man gazed at him blankly for a moment, and then burst out
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume, sir, this is your first visit to a
playhouse, and truly, I think, with these sentiments, you would
have done better to keep away.&nbsp; But as for the performance
being given for charity&mdash;&nbsp; Faith, if you were to make
such a suggestion to the manager he would tell you that charity
began at home, I fancy.&nbsp; By the time he has paid his
company, and defrayed the cost of the scenery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paid the company,&rdquo; interrupted John, &ldquo;why,
sir, do you mean to tell me that persons of such quality would
condescend to play for hire?&nbsp; High-born ladies
like&mdash;like the Duchess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His neighbour positively gaped, and then bending forward gazed
at him narrowly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believe you are purposely
acting the buffoon; you seek to impose on me by affecting an
impossible ignorance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul, sir,&rdquo; cried simple John, who was
now quite pale and could hardly speak for agitation,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis my first visit to such a place, and I&mdash;I
happen to know some of these ladies and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; said the other with a grin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, good country cousin, I will take pity on your
innocence.&nbsp; These titles here are wholly fictitious, as
indeed I think is easily seen; these names to the right are those
which either belong properly to the actors and actresses, or are
assumed by them for their greater convenience.&nbsp; Mrs Scully,
for instance, who plays Lady Olivia, chooses rather to call
herself Mrs Swynnerton, because the name has a better sound,
while as for Miss Fitzroy, who is set down for the <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>part of
Lady Lucy, that I am sure must be an assumed name, but as it is
the lady&rsquo;s first appearance upon the boards, my information
concerning her is scanty.&nbsp; I am informed that she is a
pretty little creature, and likely to prove attractive.&nbsp;
Now, sir, let me request that you will sit still.&nbsp; I assure
you it is quite unnerving to see you bouncing about in your
seat.&nbsp; Sit down; the curtain will rise in a moment; and let
me inform you, since the business is novel to you, that the first
duty of the playgoer is to refrain from disturbing the rest of
the audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John sat still; indeed, once the curtain had risen, he
remained so absolutely motionless that he might have been turned
to stone.</p>
<p>The play, which at the time of its production enjoyed an
ephemeral popularity, but has since passed into oblivion like its
author, abounded in strained situations.&nbsp; The sentiment was
superabundant, the humour forced and occasionally verging upon
coarseness, but Lady Lucy, who sustained one of the principal
parts, won tumultuous applause from first to last.&nbsp; John saw
her smiling upon her fictitious lover as she had smiled upon him,
he heard her voice, her light laugh, he marked certain little
tricks of manner, which, though he had known her for so brief a
space, seemed engraven upon his memory&mdash;and his jealous
heart seemed like to burst within him.&nbsp; He felt ashamed,
nay, personally degraded by the publicity into which she had
thrust herself.&nbsp; Good God!&nbsp; That her beauty, her charm,
her pretty ways should be thus pilloried!&nbsp; That any coarse
brute who sate aloft in the gallery was free to make his comment
because he had paid <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>his sixpence!&nbsp; That nothing
should be sacred; that she should prattle of love, and weep mock
tears, there in the glare of the footlights before all these
curious, insolent eyes, as though he and she had never clasped
hands and stammered secrets in the sanctity of the solitary
dawn.&nbsp; Oh! Heavens, it was too much!</p>
<p>The intensity of his gaze drew hers towards him before she had
been very long upon the scene, and she appeared to falter for a
moment, but speedily recovered her self-possession.</p>
<p>At the end of the first act, while he was still staring
blankly at the lowered curtain, someone touched him on the
shoulder, and, as he turned round, thrust a note into his
hand.&nbsp; He tore it open quickly, and found it contained but a
line:&mdash;&ldquo;Come to the stage door when the play is
over.&rdquo;&nbsp; Turning to speak to the messenger, he found
that he had already gone.</p>
<p>When Lady Lucy next came on the stage she played with even
greater spirit and vivacity than before, but by-and-by stole a
questioning glance at John; and John gravely nodded.&nbsp; A
thousand times, indeed, he had a mind to leave the place and to
set eyes on her no more; and still he lingered.&nbsp; With each
succeeding act Miss Fitzroy further captivated the house, and the
curtain descended at last amid tumultuous applause.</p>
<p>Slowly and gloomily John rose, and after many enquiries found
his way to the stage door, standing there motionless while
streams of gay folk passed and repassed before his eyes.</p>
<p>All at once he felt a hand upon his arm.&nbsp; A slender,
cloaked figure was beside him, and two <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>bright eyes
were gazing at him eagerly from the depths of a quilted silk
hood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; whispered Lady Lucy&rsquo;s voice,
&ldquo;here I am, John.&nbsp; I have given them all the slip that
I might talk to you for a moment.&nbsp; You must know that I have
had quite an ovation&mdash;they say that my fortune is made and
that all London will be ringing with my name to-morrow; and now
tell me, what did you think of it&mdash;how did you like
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I think of it?&rdquo; groaned John.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear, it nearly broke my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw the eager eyes flash, and felt the hand upon his arm
tremble with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she was beginning wrathfully, but broke
off and continued in a softer tone: &ldquo;You are vexed, I
suppose, because I deceived you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, madam, &rsquo;tis not that.&nbsp; I had liefer you
had told me the truth, yet that is a small matter.&nbsp; But that
you should thus exhibit yourself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She snatched away her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have kept me all to yourself, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows I would!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have the face to tell me so.&nbsp; You would
have me stifle my ambition&mdash;make nothing of my
talent&mdash;throw away the fame and fortune which are now
actually within my grasp?&nbsp; And pray, John Cotley, what would
you leave me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace of mind,&rdquo; said Cotley.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Honour&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, do you mean to insult me?&nbsp; Surely these
things must be mine in any walk of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, they are endangered by the course you <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>would
pursue.&nbsp; Give it up, I beg of you&mdash;I entreat it of
you.&nbsp; You cannot already have forgotten what has passed
between us&mdash;does it give me no right over you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in truth a strange man,&rdquo; said she
petulantly, &ldquo;though I believe you love me well in your own
odd fashion,&rdquo; and here the little hand stole back again to
his arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it is a selfish fashion, John.&nbsp;
You would take everything from me&mdash;what would you give me in
return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that I am,&rdquo; said John.&nbsp; &ldquo;All that
I have.&nbsp; My love, my home, myself.&nbsp; I came round to
this place to offer them to you once and for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very intensity of his passion made his voice sound stern,
and Lady Lucy once more jerked away her hand, and tossed her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, sir, you are mighty cool.&nbsp; Pray do
you expect me to jump at this proposal?&nbsp; I believe you
do.&nbsp; I believe you would have me on my knees with gratitude
for your condescension.&nbsp; Really it is laughable.&nbsp; Here
am I with the world at my feet, and you&mdash;you would have me
give up my whole career at your command and follow you like some
meek patient Grizzel to that dreary home of yours.&nbsp; And you
make this noble offer once for all, do you?&nbsp; You are not
disposed to renew it, should I venture to hesitate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said John Cotley: &ldquo;I am not to be
trifled with.&nbsp; It must be now or never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it shall be never!&rdquo; said Lady Lucy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Seven years passed by, and John Cotley tilled his <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>fields, and
sowed, and reaped, and rode abroad in summer heat and wintry
frosts.&nbsp; He was a hard man, his labourers said, and the
neighbours gibed at him for being morose; and John Cotley went on
his way without heeding them, though day by day the lines about
mouth and eyes deepened, and silver threads, which had no
business there, increased among his brown locks.</p>
<p>One March afternoon he was driven indoors by a heavy fall of
snow&mdash;one of those late storms which are all the more severe
because so untimely.&nbsp; He was standing, drumming impatiently
on the windowpane, and thinking with vexation of the
fruit-blossom which would be blighted, and the young growth of
root and blade which must be checked, when of a sudden, through
the muffled stillness there came a sound of imperative knocking
at the double gate.&nbsp; The men were at work in the woodshed at
the rear of the house, old Molly, who had grown deaf of late, was
busy in the kitchen: only the master was aware of the summons,
and he paused a moment as though in doubt before responding to
it.</p>
<p>The knocking came again, hurried and urgent.&nbsp; John Cotley
threw open the window and called aloud&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gate is not locked: you can come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw the latch partly lifted and then fall back again, and
the knocking was resumed, a woman&rsquo;s voice crying out at the
same time&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, it is too heavy for my strength.&nbsp; I pray you,
let me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John started and caught his breath; then hastened from the
room, with long swinging strides, and down <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>the
snow-covered path.&nbsp; The gate creaked upon its hinges, and
the figure of a lady, cloaked and hooded, stood revealed; her
hooped skirt almost filled the half-opened door, and as she
stepped past John and hurried up the sloping path that lay
between the lavender hedges&mdash;ghostly now beneath their
weight of snow&mdash;she left behind her a little track of
narrow-soled high-heeled shoes&mdash;each print of that light
foot marking on the snow what seemed to be the impression of a
flower and a leaf.&nbsp; Not a word said she, but pressed on till
she reached the house, and indeed the snow was piled upon her
shoulders and filled the creases in her hood.</p>
<p>Once safe in the hall she turned and curtsied to John, who had
followed close upon her heels, and then, throwing back her hood,
revealed to him an unforgettable face in which he nevertheless
saw much that was strange and new.&nbsp; There was new beauty to
begin with, but beauty of a different order to that young
delicate bloom which he remembered; there was a roll in the
bright eyes which had not used to be there; a somewhat
languishing smile wreathed the lovely lips.&nbsp; As she loosed
her mantle and let it drop from her shoulders, she revealed a
form in which full womanly symmetry had replaced the almost
fragile grace of early girlhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Cotley,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have come once
more to throw myself upon your hospitality.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true
my coach has not broken down, but the storm is unpleasant, and
progress is slow, and I am not ill-pleased at the prospect of
warming and refreshing myself before proceeding further.&nbsp;
Therefore, recognising <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>the aspect of the country, and
calling to mind that you lived in these parts, I desired my
servants to halt for an hour, and bethought me that I would come
and take you by surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;you do indeed take me
by surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stole at him a curious, somewhat anxious glance&mdash;but
soon laughed, and raised her eyebrows and shoulders with an
affected gesture&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie, sir! is that all you can find to say to me?&nbsp;
I vow your manners have grown rusty during these seven
years.&nbsp; I protest when I visited you last you had more
politeness.&nbsp; Do you wish, sir, to forbid me
entrance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means, madam.&nbsp; Pray come in.&nbsp; Such
entertainment as this poor house can afford shall be
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way into the parlour, and soon was on his knees by
the hearth kindling a fire.&nbsp; Outside, the snow drifted past
the window, and within all was silence, save for the rustling of
Lady Lucy&rsquo;s silken garments as she breathed quickly, and
the click of flint and steel.&nbsp; The tinder caught at last,
and by-and-by the flame leaped in the chimney.&nbsp; Then John
Cotley rose from his knees, and found Lady Lucy earnestly
considering him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not changed much, John, these seven
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I not, madam?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;the place is so
oddly familiar I could almost fancy that I had been here
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you indeed, madam?&rdquo; said John.</p>
<p><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>Leaning forward in the flickering light, and with that
earnest expression she looked wonderfully, perilously like the
other Lady Lucy whom he had once known.&nbsp; He averted his
eyes, and began to move slowly towards the door.&nbsp; She
followed him with a curious intent gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a pity that it should be snowing,
John,&rdquo; she said, and the soft voice sounded almost
caressing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a mind to see the garden.&nbsp; If
by chance it clears up by-and-by, I shall ask you to conduct me
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, madam,&rdquo; said John, pausing in the doorway,
and turning upon her a very resolute face, &ldquo;the garden
would scarcely be worth your notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I have forgotten it?&rdquo; whispered
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I ever forget that sunny morning, and the
roses, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, forget it, madam,&rdquo; said John, sternly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I assure you the roses are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he went away and left her, and presently old Molly
came, all in a flutter of wonder and delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis herself, sure,&rdquo; she cried, peering
into the beautiful pensive face of the visitor; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
Lady Lucy.&nbsp; Master come to me and says, says he, &lsquo;Get
tea ready, and everything of the best,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;A
lady has come who must be well attended to&rsquo;; but he
didn&rsquo;t never say it was your ladyship.&nbsp; Dear, my lady,
what a merry company you was, to be sure.&nbsp; Do you mind how
you all made your own beds.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wager your ladyship
has never made your bed since.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Lady Lucy, &ldquo;I have
made my own bed, Molly, and I must lie on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sate very silent and thoughtful after this; but when
refreshments were served, and John Cotley came to do the honours
of his table, she became once more all smiles and gaiety,
prattling very prettily about the great world and the folk who
dwelt there, and running on from one topic to another without
appearing to notice her host&rsquo;s gravity and silence.&nbsp;
All at once, turning to him with a challenging air, she said:
&ldquo;In this solitary retreat of yours, Mr Cotley, I presume
the news of my doings and successes have not reached
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he returned, with an added shade of
coldness in his tone, &ldquo;I must own that I have failed to
keep count of your triumphs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that is the less surprising since, according to my
flatterers, my triumphs are past reckoning.&nbsp; Do you
remember, sir;&rdquo; and here, leaning her elbows on the table
and resting her chin upon her hands, she darted a penetrating
glance towards him&mdash;&ldquo;do you remember, sir, a
conversation which we once had at early dawn?&nbsp; I, at least,
recollect it very well.&nbsp; Though you were unaware at the time
of the career I had chosen, you made several curiously apt
forecasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; returned John, &ldquo;I regret to say
that my memory is not as good as yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bit her lip, but soon recovered herself.&nbsp; Tilting
back her head slightly, and looking at him through her narrowed
lids, she continued&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You prophesied, as I recollect, that I should be
courted by the highest in the land; admired by all <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>the rank
and fashion of London.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dukes;&rsquo; said
you&mdash;and I vow you would have laughed had you but known the
gloomy despair of your face&mdash;&lsquo;dukes and marquises will
be fighting for the privilege of kissing your hand.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Well, your words have come true; many grandees have come
a-courting me; this hand of mine has been kissed by
royalty.&nbsp; And yet, John Cotley, &rsquo;tis a weary
life.&nbsp; Empty flattery, tiresome praise&mdash;a
feather-headed crew that flutter round me with unmeaning smiles
and foolish compliments.&nbsp; Not one true man among
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she paused, he bowed stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amid all my success I am sick at heart,&rdquo; she went
on, excitedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I long for a home; I long to find a
loyal heart, a hand that I could rely on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret to hear, madam,&rdquo; said Cotley, as she
paused again, &ldquo;that events have not justified your
expectations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him fixedly for a moment, and then smiling
archly, went on&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you tell me you have forgotten this conversation of
ours?&nbsp; Now, I can recall it word for word.&nbsp; When I
first emerged from under the leafy archway
yonder&rdquo;&mdash;with a wave of the hand&mdash;&ldquo;you were
standing thus&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>She rose to her feet and struck an attitude, head bent, one
hand pressed to her brow, the other clutching at the ruffles at
her breast.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I was so rude as to laugh; do you
remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the advantage of me, madam,&rdquo; said John
Cotley, sternly.</p>
<p>She continued as though she had not heard him, <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>and with a
little tremor in her voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You said some pretty
things about my being an angel, and I asked you what you knew of
me; and you said that you knew only what your eyes had shown you,
and what your heart had told you.&nbsp; Oh, John, does your heart
tell you nothing now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; said John,
steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure you have forgotten all that passed.&nbsp; I
suppose, too, that you have forgotten about those wanderings of
ours in the alleys yonder, when the leaves were green, and the
roses were blowing.&nbsp; I stumbled once, and you made me take
your arm, and I felt it trembling beneath my hand.&nbsp; Think of
that, Mr Cotley!&nbsp; Were you not a foolish youth in those
days?&nbsp; And so we walked together, and told each other
wonderful things, and I asked you to think kindly of me
always.&nbsp; Ah, John, I fear you have not kept your
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He, too, had risen and stood before her, rigid, with hands
dropping by his side, and a grey face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they called me,&rdquo; she went on, with a thrill
in her musical voice, her face earnest now and glowing,
&ldquo;they called me&mdash;there was but one moment left: I gave
you a flower, but you said it was not enough&mdash;you took my
hands and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bending forward suddenly she seized his; they were limp and
cold as ice; &ldquo;You took my hands,&rdquo; she repeated, her
voice still vibrating, her eyes fixed passionately on his,
&ldquo;you fell on your knees at my feet as I kneel to you now,
you said, you said&mdash;oh, let me say it!&mdash;&ldquo;Love,
love, stoop to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>John
Cotley gave one glance at the pleading, upturned face, at the
beautiful eyes swimming in tears, and then he withdrew his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have surpassed yourself, madam,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are certainly a marvellous actress.&nbsp;
Your rendering of the scene was absolutely perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was on her feet in a moment, dashing the tears from her
eyes and laughing unsteadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was determined to convince you of my powers,&rdquo;
cried she, in a voice which feigned lightness though it was husky
and ill-assured.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, you should feel proud, Mr
Cotley, that so famed a personage should give you a performance
all to yourself. . . .&nbsp; The storm shows no signs of abating,
I fear, so I will not trespass further on your hospitality.&nbsp;
I am much obliged to you, Mr Cotley, for your entertainment, and
now I think I will take my leave.&nbsp; My cloak and hood lie
yonder&mdash;I thank you&rdquo;&mdash;as he assisted her to put
them on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, sir, if you will have the kindness to
open the gate I will pursue my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were out of the house by this time, and she passed in
front of him towards the gate.&nbsp; When she reached it she
paused, and curtsied with averted eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, sir, I have to thank you for your generosity
and kindness.&nbsp; I need trouble you to come no
further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He watched the figure move away with stately undulating grace,
and when it was lost in the white mist he closed the gate with a
heavy sigh.&nbsp; There lay the tracks in front of him, flower
and leaf, flower and leaf, those just made showing sharp and
clear, <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>the others already half-obliterated; by nightfall all
alike would have vanished.&nbsp; The light feet would intrude no
more upon his path.</p>
<p>Going indoors he stood for a moment by the hearth, and then
drawing a note-book from his bosom, took from the little leather
pocket beneath the cover a small paper packet which he proceeded
to unfold.&nbsp; Within lay the crumbling and discoloured
remnants of what once had been a rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it go with the rest!&rdquo; said John Cotley, and
stooping he dropped it among the embers.</p>
<p>A little flame caught it, leaped up, flickered, and died
away.</p>
<h2><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>A
PRISONER OF WAR</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is nearly a hundred years ago
now since that golden October evening which made such a change in
Molly Rainford&rsquo;s life; the blue-eyed children to whom she
used to tell the story have long since been laid to rest, and her
grandchildren&mdash;old men and women now&mdash;have almost
forgotten it.&nbsp; Even the neighbours have ceased to wonder at
the odd name which they bear, and do not realise that were it not
corrupted and mispronounced, it would have a still stranger sound
in their ears.</p>
<p>On this fine October evening then, many, many years ago, Molly
Rainford was setting the house-place to rights, before the return
of her father and his men from the wheatfield, where they had
been at work since dawn.&nbsp; It was worth while growing wheat
in those days, as Farmer Joe could tell you, but it took long to
cut, and the arms grew weary that wielded the sickle, and the
sweat poured down the brown faces.&nbsp; Old Winny the servant,
and even Susan, the lass who occasionally came in to help, had
been all day in the field too, helping with other women-folk to
bind the sheaves.&nbsp; Molly would have been there herself, but
that somebody was wanted to go backwards and forwards between
house and field with food and drink for the labourers.&nbsp;
Indeed, what with carrying the ten o&rsquo;clock
&ldquo;bagging,&rdquo; the big noonday dinner, and the four <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>o&rsquo;clock &ldquo;drinkings,&rdquo; Molly&rsquo;s
arms and feet ached pretty well, but she could not sit down to
rest yet; she must bestir herself, &ldquo;straighten up&rdquo;
the house, and set out the supper&mdash;bread and cheese, cold
bacon, and plenty of small beer.</p>
<p>As she moved about the flagged room, intent on her own
thoughts, she did not at first hear a low hurried tap at the
outer door, which stood open; and it was not until a figure
passed hurriedly through it, and stepped from the passage into
the kitchen itself, that she turned round with a great start.</p>
<p>She saw a young fellow of about middle height, with a
well-knit and curiously graceful figure, fair hair, closely
cropped, and blue eyes set in a face which, though pale and
startled now, had nevertheless a certain winsomeness about
it.&nbsp; His clothes were soiled and ragged, and his feet were
bare, yet at the very first sight of him Molly realised that he
was no tramp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scream,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, and
throwing out his hand pleadingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I weren&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to scream,&rdquo; returned
Molly, briefly and calmly, and thereat the stranger
smiled&mdash;a very pleasant smile, with a flash of white teeth,
and a merry twinkle in the eyes.</p>
<p>Molly blushed all over her apple-blossom face, and dropped her
head, upon which the brown hair would never lie as smoothly as
she wished; but presently, overcoming her shyness, she fixed her
honest grey eyes upon him and said seriously: &ldquo;What might
you please to want, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you the truth,&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have escaped from prison.&nbsp; I want you to give me
shelter <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>here for a few days, until the hue and cry is over, and
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Scaped from prison!&rdquo; ejaculated
Molly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say as I won&rsquo;t scream
now,&rdquo; and she made as though she would rush past him to the
door.&nbsp; But the other stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a criminal,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have done no wrong except to fight for my own land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; said Molly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
where may that be?&nbsp; I doubt we are fighting most of the
world just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a Frenchman,&rdquo; returned he.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
name is Jean Marie Kerenec.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a name,&rdquo; cried Molly, and
dropped upon a chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jammery, d&rsquo;ye say?&nbsp;
But you speak English quite sensibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a fisherman by trade,&rdquo; said Jean,
&ldquo;and used besides to do a bit of trade with your country,
and your folks came over to us, and so I learned to speak your
language when I was quite a little boy.&nbsp; And then I&rsquo;ve
been so long in an English prison, you see.&nbsp; When the war
broke out I became a marine, and was taken prisoner with my mates
by an English man-o&rsquo;-war, and I&rsquo;ve been in prison
two&mdash;three years now.&nbsp; Life in an English prison-ship
is not gay, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t fight against us, you see,&rdquo;
said the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
know what I&rsquo;m to do.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re welly clemmed, I
reckon?&mdash;hungry, I mean,&rdquo; seeing that he stared at
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit down and eat a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to the great wooden settle, but he remained
standing until she returned with a plate of <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>bread and
meat and a jug of beer.&nbsp; Going towards her as she was
crossing the kitchen, and moving swiftly and gracefully on his
bare feet, as some lithe creature of the woods, he took her
burden from her, and, placing it on the table, sat down, and fell
to with right good will.</p>
<p>Molly went on with her work, eyeing her visitor from time to
time.&nbsp; Once, happening to intercept her glance, he smiled at
her brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know whatever my father
will say,&rdquo; muttered Molly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll haply
be angry with me for letting you stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a hard man?&rdquo; enquired Jean, his face
falling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, when father&rsquo;s not crossed there&rsquo;s no
kinder man in the whole o&rsquo; Lancashire.&nbsp; But if you go
the wrong way to work wi&rsquo; him!&nbsp; Poor Teddy, my
brother, did that, and my father turned him out.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
sorry enough about it now, poor father is, for Ted went and
&rsquo;listed and hasn&rsquo;t never been home since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger laid down his knife and fork and looked at her
earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If your brother were taken
prisoner,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would not he, your father, be
glad if he were treated kindly?&nbsp; If he had a chance of
coming home, and only wanted just what I want now, shelter for a
few days to help him, what would your father say if one refused
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; said Molly, and
the glance which she threw at the young stranger was much softer
and more encouraging than her words.</p>
<p>An hour or two wore away, and Molly finished tidying, and
spread the long tables, and fed the <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>chickens, and set her dairy to
rights.&nbsp; In all these operations Jean Marie Kerenec assisted
her, and he told her the most wonderful things the while, so that
now her eyes brightened with astonishment, and now her bonny
cheek grew pale with alarm, and sometimes her red lips would
droop and tears of compassion would hang upon her lashes.&nbsp;
But she thought her new friend an heroic and most delightful
personage.</p>
<p>When the shadows had crept over the face of the land and the
first bat circled round the house, the tramp of clogged feet, and
the sound of many voices, announced the return of the
harvesters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best hide,&rdquo; said Molly, struck with a
sudden thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, hide in the buttery till the
folks are abed and my father is having his glass comfortable by
the fire; then I&rsquo;ll tackle him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So into the buttery Jean Marie disappeared, and prudent Molly
locked the door and put the key in her pocket.&nbsp; Presently he
heard the farmer come stamping in in his top-boots, and a series
of thuds in the passage, which meant that the men, having duly
&ldquo;washed them&rdquo; at the pump, were now respectfully
divesting themselves of their clogs.&nbsp; He heard old Winny
groaning over the fatigues of the day, and Susan giggling with
some rustic admirer, and the quick tread of Molly&rsquo;s feet on
the flags as she hastened up and down the table.&nbsp; Then a
roar from Farmer Rainford&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, wilt thou, lass?&nbsp; Wheer&rsquo;s the
moog?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m that dry I could very near drink
water.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is the field nigh cut?&rsquo; says
thou.&nbsp; No, nor half-cut&rdquo; (and here the farmer rapped
out an oath or two); &ldquo;the <a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>lads don&rsquo;t work near so well
as they used to do: nor the wenches neither.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
storm-weather about.&nbsp; Thou might ha&rsquo; made shift to
come out a bit before supper&mdash;another pair of hands is worth
summat, I tell thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another pair of hands!&nbsp; Jean Marie rubbed his own in the
darkness, and drew a long breath.&nbsp; Here was a lever by which
he might help his cause.</p>
<p>Presently the scraping back of benches denoted that the meal
was at an end, and soon the sound of retreating voices announced
that the tired folk had withdrawn to their beds in attic or
outhouse.&nbsp; Then Jean Marie heard Molly speaking in a low
muffled tone, which somehow conveyed to him the impression that
she was bending over her father; and then a bellow from the old
man made the prisoner spring backwards from the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Frenchy in my house!&nbsp; What
the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, father, just think if it were our Teddy as had got
loose from prison over yon, and wanted a helpin&rsquo;
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our lad&rsquo;s noan sich a fool as to get put in
prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but he might; and the Lord might do the same to us
as we do to yon poor chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me, ye silly wench, as the Lord
&rsquo;ud go for to treat a good honest Englishman same as a fool
of a Frenchy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks just like an Englishman, father, and he speaks
English much the same as we do.&nbsp; He seems as nice as could
be, and that handy going about the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; called out Jean Marie from the place
of his concealment, his voice sounding thin and strange through
the keyhole; &ldquo;Sir, I could help with the reaping; you said
you wanted another pair of hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Farmer Joe, and then he
fell a-laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s sense in what
the chap says&mdash;I&rsquo;m terribly short-handed just
now.&nbsp; Come out, sin&rsquo; thou&rsquo;rt theer, and
let&rsquo;s have a look at thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door being unlocked, Jean emerged from the buttery, and
stepped lightly across the floor on his bare feet.&nbsp; Taking
up his position opposite old Rainford, he first extended for
inspection a pair of powerful hands, and then, pulling up his
ragged shirt-sleeves, displayed the magnificent muscles of his
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will that do?&rdquo; he enquired quaintly.</p>
<p>The farmer slapped him on the back, with a roar of
laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, my lad; that&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Od&rsquo;s bobs, they arms &rsquo;ud do
credit to an Englishman!&nbsp; Coom, we&rsquo;s see how mich work
thou can get through to-morrow.&nbsp; How long dost thou want to
bide here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till the end of the week, if I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;ll do well enough; we&rsquo;s have
finished field by then.&nbsp; How wilt thou get away,
think&rsquo;st thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of mine will meet me a little further down the
coast in a fishing-boat.&nbsp; You see, I am trusting you,
sir.&nbsp; I am sure you will keep my secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>&ldquo;You may be sure, lad.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not the
mon to betray yo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; put in Molly,
&ldquo;we must lend Mester John some o&rsquo; our Ted&rsquo;s
cloo&rsquo;es, and a pair o&rsquo; clogs, and we must tell
folks&mdash;I think we&rsquo;d best tell folks as he&rsquo;s a
friend o&rsquo; yours as has coom to help wi&rsquo; the
harvest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan was put into execution.&nbsp; To the work-people it
seemed natural enough that &ldquo;Mester&rdquo; had called in
additional help in the emergency, and the intimate terms on which
the new comer seemed to be with the daughter of the house lent
credit to the supposition.</p>
<p>Jean Marie worked manfully in the wheat-field, but in the
evenings, and every spare moment during the day, he was at
Molly&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; He pumped water for her, carried her
pail, swept up her kitchen, and even lit the fire before she came
down in the morning.&nbsp; He had such pleasant ways withal, and
such a kindly smile, that it was no wonder Molly smiled on him in
return, and that the work-people soon began to whisper that she
and the &ldquo;Liverpool mon&rdquo; were
&ldquo;coortin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the evening of the third day, work being finished, and Jean
outstripping his mates, and finding Molly alone in the kitchen,
was greeted by her so cordially that somehow&mdash;he never quite
knew how&mdash;he found his arm round her waist, and words of
love leaping to his lips.&nbsp; She was an angel, a darling; he
would never love anyone but her, and she must love him too; he
must go away now, but when the war was over he would come back,
and they must be married.</p>
<p><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>&ldquo;But my father will never allow it,&rdquo;
stammered Molly, making no attempt, however, to disengage
herself.</p>
<p>And at this most inopportune moment in walked Farmer
Joe.&nbsp; The state of things that ensued can be imagined.&nbsp;
The old farmer&rsquo;s fury; Jean Marie&rsquo;s protestations;
Molly&rsquo;s tearful and inconsequent assurances, first, that
she knew nothing about it, and that it wasn&rsquo;t her fault,
secondly, that &ldquo;as how &rsquo;twas&rdquo; she would never
have any other sweetheart.</p>
<p>After a time, however, peace was in some measure restored; the
young folks silently resolved to achieve their end, while Farmer
Joe loudly announced that, as the chap was bound to leave in
two-three days, he&rsquo;d keep his word to him for this time,
but he&rsquo;d be domned if he didn&rsquo;t give him up if ever
he showed his face there again.</p>
<p>After that he interfered no more, and though he was well aware
that Jean and Molly continued their courting on the sly, he left
them alone, and, except for an occasional sarcasm anent
&ldquo;Frenchies&rdquo; and &ldquo;frog-eaters,&rdquo; made no
attempt to molest Jean.</p>
<p>On the morning of the day fixed for the young man&rsquo;s
departure, however, he received news which changed his
contemptuous indifference into active hatred and fury.&nbsp; He
came staggering into the kitchen with an ashy-white face and
starting eyeballs.&nbsp; Parson Bradley had been with him, and
had announced to him the death of his son, Teddy, in foreign
parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;n killed him,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Those domned <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>Frenchies ha&rsquo; killed my
lad.&nbsp; See, here&rsquo;s his name in th&rsquo; paper parson
brought me.&nbsp; Eh, my lad&mdash;and I druv him fro&rsquo; the
door!&nbsp; And now they&rsquo;n killed him, the domned
raskils!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molly gave a cry, and flung her apron over her head, and Jean
came forward, full of genuine distress and sympathy.&nbsp; But at
sight of him the old man&rsquo;s face became suddenly suffused
with a rush of returning colour; he babbled with inarticulate
rage, and shook his fist threateningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soombry &rsquo;ll pay for this,&rdquo; he cried, as
soon as he could speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have no
murderers in my house.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have blood for
blood.&nbsp; Does not the Book say &lsquo;an eye for an
eye&rsquo;?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have life for life, I tell
yo&rsquo;.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll revenge my son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father, father,&rdquo; wept Molly, throwing herself
at his feet, &ldquo;dunnot say that!&nbsp; Dunnot look at John so
wicked!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s innocent, poor lad.&nbsp; The Book says
more nor they things; it says, &lsquo;Vengeance is mine, saith
the Lord,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;Do as yo&rsquo; would be done
by.&rsquo;&nbsp; We&rsquo;n killed hundreds and thousands of
Frenchmen, I reckon, but if poor Teddy were alive in the hands of
his enemies yo&rsquo;d think it a cruel thing if he were made to
answer for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a volley of oaths the farmer was stooping forward to
thrust her away, when there sounded of a sudden a tramping of
feet without, and a heavy knock at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve come for me!&rdquo; said Jean, turning
very pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Molly, my loved one, they will take me
away; we shall&mdash;never meet again.&nbsp; Let us thank God for
these happy days.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>She
had risen and flown to him, and his arms were about her, when the
knocking came again, loud and continuous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open there, in the King&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; cried an
imperious voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse yo&rsquo;, Molly, go to the door!&rdquo; growled
her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, sweetheart,&rdquo; said Jean, releasing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father,&rdquo; gasped Molly, as she crept with
lagging steps across the room, &ldquo;father,
remember&mdash;yo&rsquo; gave your word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door swung back, and in an instant the room, as it seemed
to Molly, was full of soldiers.&nbsp; Their leader, after a brief
glance round, which took in, apparently without any deep
interest, the old man leaning forward in his chair, the trembling
girl, and the fair-haired young labourer standing in the
background, addressed himself to the master of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Farmer Rainford, I presume?&nbsp; I am in
search of an escaped French prisoner of war, who, it is supposed,
is in hiding in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; A suspicious-looking
French craft has been hovering about Formby Cove since
yesterday.&nbsp; May I ask if you&rsquo;ve seen any stranger
about your premises during the last few days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Joe lifted his heavy eyes, and gazed at the speaker
stolidly, but without saying a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please to excuse my father, sir,&rdquo; faltered Molly,
coming quickly forward, &ldquo;We&rsquo;n just had bad
news&mdash;terrible bad news, and he&rsquo;s upset.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;n just heard as my only brother was killed by the <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>French.&nbsp; See, there&rsquo;s his name in the
paper&mdash;Corporal Edward Rainford of the King&rsquo;s
Own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She snatched the paper from her father&rsquo;s hand as she
spoke, and pointed out the marked place with a trembling
finger.&nbsp; Joe made an inarticulate sound, and then clapped
his hand before his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said the officer, with
momentary compassion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Mr Rainford, we
won&rsquo;t trouble you.&nbsp; You can tell us what we want to
know, my girl.&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t noticed any stranger about
the place lately?&nbsp; Your labourers are all known to
you?&nbsp; No ragged-looking fellow has come to the door to beg
for alms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molly had been shaking her head vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir! oh no, sir!&rdquo; she now cried
eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody about but our own
folks as has worked for us ever sin&rsquo; I can remember; and
there&rsquo;s nobody in this house but my father and
mysel&rsquo;, and old Winny the servant, and my sweetheart
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the officer, laughing,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s your sweetheart, is it?&nbsp; He seems a
likely lad.&nbsp; Why isn&rsquo;t he out fighting for his
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please sir, I couldn&rsquo;t spare him!&rdquo;
cried Molly, laughing with white lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;It &rsquo;ud
fair break my heart if anything was to happen to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her feigned laughter was strangled by her sobs.&nbsp; Her
father uttered a groan, and let his head drop forward into his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dom they raskil Frenchies!&rdquo; he cried:
&ldquo;they&rsquo;n been and killed my only son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, men,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
take ourselves off.&nbsp; This is not a likely place for a French
<a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>prisoner
to take refuge in.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d soon give him up,
wouldn&rsquo;t you, Mr Rainford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Rain ford raised his head and looked at him steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;n heerd what my lass telled yo&rsquo;,&rdquo;
he said, doggedly; &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t nobry here, nobbut
me, and her,&mdash;and her sweetheart!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>THROUGH THE COTTAGE WINDOW</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gable end of the cottage faced
the shore, and I first became conscious of the window by the
sudden appearance of a faint light behind its narrow panes.&nbsp;
It was a stormy evening, the wind sweeping down between the dunes
in sudden gusts that caught up the sand from their steep
sides&mdash;which were indeed but sparsely covered with
stargrass&mdash;and sent it driving seawards in blinding
eddies.&nbsp; I had wandered overlong about the damp stretch of
shore that bordered the remains of the submarine forest,
interested first by the curious contrasts of colour to be noticed
there&mdash;the silvery sweep of sand sloping downwards to the
dusky purplish brown of the remnants aforesaid, in the irregular
surface of which little pools and rivulets of water reflected the
sky; the blue-green of the star-grass interspersed with patches
of dwarf willows and bilberry plants, the foliage of which at
this season had taken on a variety of tints.&nbsp; Later on, when
the tide had come roaring and leaping in, I had been attracted by
the magnificence of its fury, and had watched wave after wave
roll towards me, gathering and swelling as though with suppressed
rage, and finally breaking with a boom that went echoing through
the hills, while the spray dashed ever higher and higher.&nbsp;
Fascinated as I had been by the sight, I did not notice that the
early autumnal sunset was <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>over, until a sudden roller, more
adventurous than its fellows, came rushing to my very feet, and,
turning hurriedly to escape from it, I observed that the world
behind me was wrapped in gloom, save for the lingering glare at
the horizon.&nbsp; Almost at the moment that I became aware of
the approach of night, I became also conscious that the gusts of
wind before alluded to no longer carried stinging clouds of sand
with them, but were laden with a cold mist of rain almost as
painful to meet, a mist which, indeed, as I hastily threaded my
way through the yielding sand, soon turned to a downpour.</p>
<p>Clearly, unless I wished to be drenched as well as benighted
on this lonely waste, I must at once seek shelter; and, while I
was disconsolately wondering whither I should bend my steps, a
sudden ray of light drew my attention to the little habitation I
had before noticed.&nbsp; Drawing my cloak closely round me I
made my way thither with all the speed I could muster, and
knocked loudly at the closed door; but my summons passed
unheeded, being most probably unheard in the increasing fury of
the gale; and, after repeated raps on the panels and rattlings of
the latch, I went round to the window, in the hope that my
efforts to attract attention might meet with some success from
this point.&nbsp; No curtain hung behind the panes, and pressing
my face close to them I peered into the room within.&nbsp; It was
a small kitchen, kept with a neatness and cleanliness which one
learns to expect among north-country folk.&nbsp; A small fire
burnt upon the hearth, and a candle flickered in a tin sconce
over the homely mantle-shelf.&nbsp; By the light of these I
descried the <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>figure of a woman sitting by the hearth; her hands were
folded on her lap, and her eyes were fixed upon the fire.&nbsp;
She might have been any age between fifty and sixty; the slight
and erect form, and handsome face, rendered remarkable by
strongly-marked black brows, would incline one to name the lesser
figure, had not the deep lines about eyes and mouth, and the
snow-white, if still abundant hair, inclined one to think her an
older woman.</p>
<p>But I was in no mood to examine or criticise just then; with
my face still close to the casement I tapped sharply on the
topmost pane.&nbsp; The woman started, and turned her face
towards me, grasping the elbows of her chair with both hands, but
not otherwise attempting to move.&nbsp; I tapped again, more
impatiently.&nbsp; Still remaining seated she stretched out both
arms towards the window, a smile breaking over her face.&nbsp;
Such a strange smile!&nbsp; Tender, even yearning, and yet one
might almost say, fearful.</p>
<p>Losing patience, I tapped again, and nodded.&nbsp; With arms
still stretched out she slowly left her chair and dropped upon
her knees.</p>
<p>Then taking advantage of a momentary lull in the storm I shook
the crazy casement and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me in; I shall be wet to the skin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length she rose hurriedly to her feet; then, shading her
eyes with her hand, made her way towards me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, dear!&rdquo; she cried, as she drew near;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not him&mdash;&rsquo;tis a wumman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do let me in,&rdquo; I pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;See
how it <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>rains!&nbsp; I only ask for shelter until the storm is
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She signed to me to go round to the door, and in another
moment my feet were on the sanded floor within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;yo&rsquo;re
wet, ma&rsquo;am; yo&rsquo;re terrible wet.&nbsp; I wish
I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; heerd yo&rsquo; before, but wind and rain
were makkin&rsquo; sich a din I didn&rsquo;t notice
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you did notice, you took me for a ghost, I
think,&rdquo; I said, laughing, but feeling still a little
aggrieved.</p>
<p>No trace of the strange expression which I had noticed on her
face when I had first summoned her lingered there as she admitted
me, but at these careless words of mine I saw it come again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coom nigh the fire,&rdquo; she said, after a pause,
during which she had gazed at me as one half awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you take me for a ghost?&rdquo; I persisted, as I
drew near the hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took yo&rsquo; fur&mdash;summat,&rdquo; she answered
doggedly.&nbsp; Then, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, she began
to press me hospitably to dry my &ldquo;shoon,&rdquo; and
informed me that she would &ldquo;mak&rsquo; tay in a two-three
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;re out late,&rdquo; she added presently,
gazing at me as I basked in the comfortable warmth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dun yo&rsquo; coom fro&rsquo; far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have walked along the shore from Saltleigh,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am staying at the inn there.&nbsp; It is not
very far.&nbsp; When the storm is over I shall make my way back
by road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she commented, bending down to fill the
little brown teapot from the now bubbling kettle.</p>
<p><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>As
she did so I caught sight of the glitter of a wedding-ring upon
the gnarled brown hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you live here all alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; affirmatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been married, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your husband is dead, I suppose?&rdquo;&nbsp; Again the
curious look, but no answer.&nbsp; I repeated my question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he is dead, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she replied in
a low voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yigh, I met say I know he&rsquo;s
dead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s thirty-five year sin&rsquo; he
went&mdash;he mun be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he not die here, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, ma&rsquo;am, he wur a sailor.&nbsp; He deed at say
on jest sich a night as this.&nbsp; He deed, and he thought on
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile which I had seen once before, which held so much of
love, and yet had in it a suggestion of fear, hovered about her
lips again for a moment, and was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tay&rsquo;s drawed nice now,&rdquo; she said in a
different tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will yo&rsquo; please to pull up,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; motioning me to draw my chair nearer the
table.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve soom leet cake here as I&rsquo;ll
toast in a minute, but I have na&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; butter,
I&rsquo;m sorry to tell yo&rsquo;; yo&rsquo; mun mak&rsquo; shift
wi&rsquo;out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I murmured my thanks for the generosity with which she had
set before me the best her house contained, and emphatically
assured her that I infinitely preferred light cake without
butter, my hostess reseated herself in her elbow-chair, and gazed
at me, while I ate and drank, with evident satisfaction.&nbsp;
But she did not speak, and each <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>furtive glance that I sent in her
direction increased my curiosity.</p>
<p>It was such a handsome face, with its great dark eyes, its
still beautiful colouring, its expression of reserved strength,
of patience, of&mdash;what was it?&nbsp; Expectation or
longing?&nbsp; A little of both, perhaps, but all placid and
contained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be very lonely,&rdquo; I said, pushing away my
cup at length, and leaning back in my chair.&nbsp; She looked up
quickly, sighed, and suffered her hands to drop together in her
lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am that,&rdquo; she said, half to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long were you married before you lost your
husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobbut a year,&rdquo; she returned; &ldquo;scarce a
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So short a time!&nbsp; How very sad.&nbsp; It must have
seemed hard to you that he should go to sea and leave
you&mdash;but of course he had to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yigh, ma&rsquo;am, he had to do it&mdash;but I took it
very ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice had sunk, so that the words were scarcely audible;
it seemed to me that there were tears in the dark eyes.&nbsp;
Impulsively leaving my chair I knelt down by her side, taking the
worn hands in mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all forgiven now,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
few hasty words are forgotten, but the memory of the love
remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, still speaking half to herself,
&ldquo;all&rsquo;s forgiven now&mdash;all wur forgiven long
sin&rsquo;&mdash;before he deed.&nbsp; He thought of me before he
deed, and loved me jest same as ever.&nbsp; He looked at me so
lovin&rsquo;&mdash;God rest him!&nbsp; He was never one to bear a
grudge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you said he died at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>&ldquo;Yigh, he deed at say, fur sure,&rdquo; she
added, looking at me as though in surprise; &ldquo;but I knowed
he loved me and forgave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of his comrades told you all about it, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, nobry towd me&mdash;nobbut
hissel&rsquo;.&nbsp; His mates was all drownded, too; naught was
niver heerd on &rsquo;em at arter ship sailed that last
time.&nbsp; Noan of &rsquo;em ever coom back&mdash;nobbut him,
and he coomed to nobry but me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that his spirit came back?&rdquo; I asked,
half-incredulously, half awe-stricken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, I can&rsquo;t reetly tell you how he coom
back, but it was him.&nbsp; He coomed to tell me he wur dead, and
to let me know as he&rsquo;d forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was nothing ever heard of his ship?&rdquo; I
enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naught was niver heerd of ship, nor captain, nor
crew,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Noan of &rsquo;em coom back,
nobbut my Will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind raging round the house drove the rain fiercely
against the little window, and I glanced towards it fearfully;
then, laughing inwardly at my own folly, I turned to the woman
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it may have been fancy?&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are so lonely here, you see, and you had
been fretting perhaps because of your little quarrel, and because
you had, I suppose, no news of him.&nbsp; And then you imagined
you saw his face&mdash;at the window&mdash;was it? he used
perhaps to come to the window&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;he all&rsquo;ays
coom theer&mdash;all&rsquo;ays fro&rsquo; the time when he wur a
little lad.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d coom theer, and press his face to
the window, and tap <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>three times same as yo&rsquo; did
to-neet&mdash;he all&rsquo;ays tapped three times.&nbsp; And I
used to look up from my little stool i&rsquo; the corner and nod
at him, and at arter a bit get up and stale out when feyther and
moother wurna lookin&rsquo;&mdash;fur they&rsquo;d all&rsquo;ays
barge if they cotched me playin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; Will
Davis.&nbsp; The Davises were cocklin&rsquo; folk&mdash;very
rough&mdash;a bad lot &rsquo;twas said, and my feyther
didn&rsquo;t reckon to let me go wi&rsquo; &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But
my Will, he was never same as t&rsquo;others&mdash;a gradely
little lad he wur, good at&rsquo;s books and never up to no
mischeef.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll noan be a cocklemon same as my
feyther,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d say; &lsquo;when I goo to say
I&rsquo;ll goo a bit fur&rsquo;er off.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll sail fur,
wheer theer&rsquo;s no lond an&rsquo; no houses, an&rsquo; no
naught, nobbut wayter, wayter, wayter&mdash;same as it says in my
book.&rsquo;&nbsp; Folks thought it a wonderful thing to see a
little chap same as him goin&rsquo; so reg&rsquo;lar to
school.&nbsp; But t&rsquo;other lads &rsquo;ud laugh at him for
goin&rsquo; barefoot; poor Will, he hadn&rsquo;t niver a shoe to
his foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off to laugh softly to herself; her eyes were again
fixed, on the fire, and her mind had evidently conjured up a
vivid picture of the lad as he had been in bygone days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, I mind when he&rsquo;d coom patterin&rsquo; ower
th&rsquo; weet sand to this place he&rsquo;d leave tracks
o&rsquo;s little bare feet all round the house; and my feyther
&rsquo;ud barge and sauce me terrible if he coom out and saw
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yon little raskil Will&rsquo;s been here
again,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d say; &lsquo;my word, I&rsquo;ll thrash
him if I cotch him here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And moother, hoo&rsquo;d tak&rsquo; me by the ear, and
drag me across the kitchen and sit me down on my stool <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>i&rsquo;
th&rsquo; corner wi&rsquo; my patchwork.&nbsp; &lsquo;If thou
dar&rsquo;s so mich as say a word to yon agin&rsquo;, hoo&rsquo;d
say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch birch-rod to thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But &rsquo;tweren&rsquo;t o&rsquo; no use.&nbsp; Soon
as ever I&rsquo;d hear the three taps, and see the roguish
e&rsquo;en o&rsquo; Will laughin&rsquo; in at me through the
window, I&rsquo;d mak&rsquo; my way to him soom gate.&nbsp; Yigh,
I wur terrible headstrong.&nbsp; Poor mother&mdash;hoo&rsquo;d a
done better to ha&rsquo; takken rod to me&mdash;but hoo never did
more nor talk&mdash;hoo thought the warld o&rsquo; me, and so did
my feyther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were your parents alive when you married?&rdquo; I
inquired, breaking in upon the somewhat lengthy silence which
ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, ma&rsquo;am, they deed both on &rsquo;em, when I
wur eighteen year of age.&nbsp; My aunt coomed to live wi&rsquo;
me then for a bit, but we didn&rsquo;t get on so well.&nbsp; Will
had been sailorin&rsquo; for nigh upon five year then, and I only
seed him now and agin.&nbsp; Eh, I mind well the time he coom at
arter feyther and moother deed.&nbsp; I had my blacks on, fur it
were market day, and me and my aunt had been down to th&rsquo;
village.&nbsp; We had afallin&rsquo; out as we coom we&rsquo;re
ways awhoam again, and my aunt hoo&rsquo;d gone straight to her
chamber, and hoo said hoo didn&rsquo;t want no tay, and
hoo&rsquo;d pack up and go next morn and leave me alone, for I
wur but an ill-mannered, ill-tempered wench.&nbsp; Well, I coom
in and sot me down here in cheer, and I got a-gate o&rsquo;
cryin&rsquo;, for I wur feelin&rsquo; quite undone to think
o&rsquo; my aunt goin&rsquo; that gate, and I wur thinkin&rsquo;
how lonely I was, and what a miserable thing it war for a lass to
be left same as me wi&rsquo;out feyther nor moother, when all of
a sudden I heerd Will knockin&rsquo; at the pane.&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t I jump up, and <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>didn&rsquo;t I run out, and
didn&rsquo;t he cotch me in&rsquo;s arms and kiss me same as
nobry&rsquo;d ever kissed me afore!&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, my
lass,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;wast thou cryin&rsquo;?&nbsp; I
never see those bonny e&rsquo;en o&rsquo; thine wi&rsquo; tears
in &rsquo;em afore.&nbsp; Why, what wast thou cryin&rsquo; for,
Molly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked up in his face&mdash;eh, it was a bonny face,
and so kind and anxious like, that I fair burst out again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Coom, lass,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;we&rsquo;s ha&rsquo; no
more tears, but thou mun tell me all about it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Eh, well,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m cryin&rsquo;
because I am a cross, bad-tempered lass and nobry can&rsquo;t
a-bear to live i&rsquo; th&rsquo; house wi&rsquo;
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Coom, is that all?&rsquo; says he, and he
laughed till he fair shook; &lsquo;I know soombry as could manage
very well to live i&rsquo; th&rsquo; same house as thee.&nbsp;
Coom, give over&mdash;I thought &rsquo;t were summat war when I
see thee i&rsquo; thy blacks and all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, but it is war,&rsquo; says I,
&lsquo;feyther and moother are dead o&rsquo; the fever, and I am
left wi&rsquo; nobry but my aunt Jane, and her and me cannot
agree, and we had words coomin&rsquo; awhoam fro&rsquo; market,
and hoo says hoo wunnot live wi&rsquo; me no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Eh, dear, eh, dear, there&rsquo;s a tale,&rsquo;
says he; &lsquo;coom, will Aunt Jane eat me, dost thou think, if
I ax to coom in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo cannot eat thee if hoo wants to,&rsquo; says I,
howdin&rsquo; up my head.&nbsp; &lsquo;This house belongs to me
now, and I am missus.&rsquo;&nbsp; We were steppin&rsquo; inside
then, and Will put his two hands o&rsquo; my shoulders and turned
my face to the leet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou&rsquo;rt missus, art thou?&rsquo; says
Will, &lsquo;but thou&rsquo;ll&rsquo;t tak a master soom day, my
wench.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Master,&rsquo; says I, half laughin&rsquo; and
half cryin&rsquo;; &lsquo;I dunno.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t fancy
callin&rsquo; nobry my master.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>&ldquo;He looked down at me so earnest for a bit, and
then he smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dunnot tell me that tale,&rsquo;
says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who was it I see cryin&rsquo; when I looked
in; cryin&rsquo;, because hoo was so lonely?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want a master, as how
&rsquo;tis,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well then,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;give it
another name.&nbsp; Say husband, Molly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what husband?&rsquo; says I, knowin&rsquo;
very well what he was at, but lettin&rsquo; on I didn&rsquo;t
understand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not a farmer,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;for
I&rsquo;m not good enough to be a farmer&rsquo;s missus; and not
a cottager&rsquo;s,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;for I&rsquo;m too good
to be a poor man&rsquo;s slave; and not a soldier fur sure, for
soldiers goes to the wars and gets killed; and not a
sailor&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And why not a sailor, Molly,&rsquo; says
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sailors has half a dozen wives they sayn,&rsquo;
I answered him back as impudent as you please, &lsquo;and what
good would it do me t&rsquo; wed wi&rsquo; a mon who was always
at say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sailors gets paid off ship now and again; then
they likes to think there&rsquo;s a little whoam and a little
wife waitin&rsquo; for &rsquo;em.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a miserable
thing,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;to know as theer&rsquo;s nobry
lookin&rsquo; out for yo&rsquo;, nobry as cares whether you are
dead or wick, no place wheer yo&rsquo;re made welcome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Poor Will,&rsquo; says I, wi&rsquo; my face
turned away, and my e&rsquo;en cast down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not poor
Will, for Will knowed theer wur soombry thinkin&rsquo; on him,
and soombry lookin&rsquo; out for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will tak&rsquo;s too much conceit in
hissel&rsquo;,&rsquo; says I, makkin&rsquo; shift to spake
&rsquo;ard like.&nbsp; But he geet his arm round me again and
pulled round my face to <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>leet, an&rsquo; then it wur all ower
wi&rsquo; me&mdash;he see plain enough as he&rsquo;d spokken
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She relapsed into silence again, her face wearing a soft and
tender smile that made it look almost young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So when he came to court you he looked at you first
through the window?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>Her face changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yigh, ma&rsquo;am; and it wur theer he took his last
look at me afore he went away and left me.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d been
married then a good few month and I niver thought he&rsquo;d be
for leaving me again till I noticed as he wur gettin&rsquo; a bit
onsattled-like.&nbsp; And wan neet he sot up in bed and shriked
out, &lsquo;Say&rsquo;s callin&rsquo; me, Molly! say&rsquo;s
callin&rsquo; me.&rsquo;&nbsp; I towd him &rsquo;twere nonsense
and he mun ha&rsquo; been dreamin&rsquo;, and he said no moor,
but next day he went wanderin&rsquo; up and down, up and down,
yon by the shore.&nbsp; An&rsquo; he didn&rsquo;t seem like
hissel&rsquo;.&nbsp; And a two&rsquo;three days at arter a letter
coom for him, and when he read it he went first red and then
white as a sheet.&nbsp; &lsquo;What does it say?&rsquo; I
axed.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s fro&rsquo; my owd captain,&rsquo;
says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;He wants me to jine th&rsquo; ship
agin.&nbsp; Molly, Molly,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;I towd thee say
was callin&rsquo; me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, Will, dunnot be a
fool,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou mun write and tell captain
as thou&rsquo;s wed and has gettin&rsquo; wark upo&rsquo; dry
lond, and as he mun look out for soombry else.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
Will he coom aroun&rsquo; table to me and looked into my
e&rsquo;en, an&rsquo; his own face were half-sorrowful, and
half-j&rsquo;yful.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, my lass,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;but I mun go.&nbsp; Sailors same as me connot live long
wi&rsquo;out they feel the wayter under them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;s not
be long away fro&rsquo; thee, my <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>bonny wench&mdash;captain says it
&rsquo;ull be nobbut a short v&rsquo;yage, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
be fain to get awhoam again&mdash;but I feel as I mun
go.&rsquo;&nbsp; I pulled his two hands down and I pushed him
fro&rsquo; me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou&rsquo;rt be fain to get
back,&rsquo; says I&mdash;&lsquo;nay, but thou&rsquo;rt fain to
go.&nbsp; I tell thee if thou goes I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er
ha&rsquo; no more to say to thee.&nbsp; If thou can do
wi&rsquo;out me I can do wi&rsquo;out thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then
I geet agate o&rsquo; cryin&rsquo;.&nbsp; &lsquo;Eh,&rsquo; I
said, &lsquo;I didna think thou&rsquo;d sarve me that gate.&nbsp;
Thou&rsquo;rt a false &rsquo;ard-&rsquo;arted deceivin&rsquo;
felly&mdash;that&rsquo;s what thou art, Will Davis!&nbsp; What
brought thee here wi&rsquo; thy soft words, an&rsquo; thy
lovin&rsquo; ways&mdash;lees all on &rsquo;em&mdash;to tak&rsquo;
all as I had, and mysel&rsquo; along wi&rsquo; it&mdash;to tee
me, hand and foot, and then to go away and leave me?&rsquo;&nbsp;
I throwed apron over my head and sobbed like a child, but my
cheeks were as hot as two coals wi&rsquo; anger.&nbsp; First Will
tried to pull away th&rsquo; apron, but I held fast and stopped
my ears as soon as ever he began o&rsquo; speakin&rsquo;, and
arter a bit he gave o&rsquo;er, and went away
whistlin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I wouldna speak a word all that day, nor
yet the next, though I see him gettin&rsquo; together his things
and makkin&rsquo; ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late i&rsquo; th&rsquo; arternoon he coom and stood by
my cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My wench,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;sin&rsquo; thou
wunnot speak to me nor look at me, I may as well be off at
wonst.&nbsp; Captain towd me jine him soon as ever I
could.&rsquo;&nbsp; My heart wur like lead, but I kept my face
turned away from him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says I,
&lsquo;sin&rsquo; thou wants to go, thou can go for aught I
care.&rsquo;&nbsp; He stood a bit longer, and then he stooped his
face down to mine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Coom, Molly,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;gie us a kiss, and let&rsquo;s part good freends.&nbsp;
Thou&rsquo;rt a bit vexed still, but <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>when thou cooms to think it ower
thou&rsquo;lt see I wur nobbut reet.&nbsp; A man mun stick to the
lot he&rsquo;s chose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what about the wife he&rsquo;s chose?&rsquo;
cries I.&nbsp; And I pushed away his face and pushed back
cheer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, I&rsquo;ll noan gi&rsquo;e thee a
kiss.&nbsp; Go thy ways and leave me.&rsquo;&nbsp; He waited a
bit longer, but I didn&rsquo;t turn my head; and then he took up
his bundle and went out.&nbsp; I heard his step on th&rsquo;
sand, very slow and lingerin&rsquo;, and then I heard his tap on
th&rsquo; window.&nbsp; &lsquo;Coom, my wench,&rsquo; he called
out; &lsquo;gi&rsquo;e us a look then.&nbsp; Gi&rsquo;e us a look
sin&rsquo; thou&rsquo;lt gie me naught else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I hitched my cheer round and turned my back on
him.&nbsp; Eh, my lad!&nbsp; Eh, my poor lad, I might ha&rsquo;
seen thy bonny face then and I wouldna look.&nbsp; Eh, I wonder
the Lord didna strike me down dead that day for my wicked pride
and anger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She brought down one clenched hand upon the open palm of the
other with such sudden fiery energy that for a moment the veil of
years was lifted, and I saw before me the passionate, resentful
girl-wife who has sent her husband from her with such a sore and
angry heart.</p>
<p>By-and-by I saw tears upon her withered cheeks, and gently
patting the nearest hand I said consolingly, &ldquo;Do not fret;
it is all over long ago, and you know you told me you felt he had
forgiven you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she sighed, lifting the
corner of her apron to her eyes with her disengaged hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I knowed that long ago.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell yo&rsquo;
about it.&nbsp; It seems to coomfort me like to talk about
him.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas jest sich a neet as this&mdash;I wur
sittin&rsquo; nigh to fire <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>thinkin&rsquo; on
him&mdash;he&rsquo;d been gone a good few months then, and I
began o&rsquo; wonderin&rsquo; how soon I met reckon to see him
back, and to plan what a welcome I&rsquo;d gi&rsquo;e him.&nbsp;
Eh, I wur ashamed o&rsquo; mysel&rsquo; and my ill-tempers by
that time, and I thought soon as ever I see him comin&rsquo;
I&rsquo;d run and throw my arms round&rsquo;s neck and ax his
parden.&nbsp; And then I&rsquo;d bring him in, I thought, and set
him i&rsquo; th&rsquo; cheer here, and tell him that the wife and
the whoam would always be ready and waitin&rsquo; for him.&nbsp;
But all on a sudden I bethought mysel&rsquo; that it wur a very
stormy neet, and I geet all of a shake thinkin&rsquo; of him out
yon on the dark wayter, and every time the big waves &rsquo;ud
lep up an&rsquo; roar upo&rsquo; the shore, I&rsquo;d beat my
breast and pray to the Lord to ha&rsquo; mercy on the folks at
say, and not to let my dear lad dee wi&rsquo;out I see him agin
and knowed he forgive me.&nbsp; It got to be a dark neet, but I
couldna go to bed, but sot here cryin&rsquo; and prayin&rsquo; by
the fire till the cowd grey morn coom.&nbsp; And then there coom
a quiet minute, as if storm was howdin&rsquo; back for summat,
and I heard plain the three taps o&rsquo; th&rsquo; window as
Will always made, and I looked up and there he wur, lookin&rsquo;
at me and smilin&rsquo; so lovin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I jumped up
fro&rsquo; my cheer&mdash;this here cheer as was stood in this
here corner jest as it is now, and I ran towards window, and I
see him plain&mdash;as plain as I see you jest now.&nbsp; His
face were a bit pale, and the wayter wur drippin&rsquo;
fro&rsquo;s hair, and fro&rsquo;s cloo&rsquo;es&mdash;he was as
weet as weet.&nbsp; But he stood there smilin&rsquo;, and
lookin&rsquo; at me lovin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bide a bit,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
oppen door in a minute.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I ran to door, and
oppened it, and <a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>wind and rain coom rushin&rsquo; in.&nbsp; Down yon on
the shore I could hear waves rushin&rsquo; and
roarin&rsquo;&mdash;I could scarce mak&rsquo; my voice heerd
wi&rsquo; th&rsquo; din.&nbsp; &lsquo;Coom in, Will,&rsquo; says
I, &lsquo;coom in.&nbsp; Dunnot stond theer i&rsquo; th&rsquo;
wind and the rain.&nbsp; Coom in to thy wife.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
nobry answered, and then I run round the corner, wrastlin&rsquo;
wi&rsquo; the wind as was near liftin&rsquo; me off my feet, and
when I come to the window there weren&rsquo;t nobry theer.&nbsp;
Eh, you may think how I skriked out.&nbsp; I run round the house
agin and looked in at door, but theer warn&rsquo;t nobry inside,
and then I coom out agin, and sarched and sarched, an&rsquo;
called an&rsquo; called, but I heerd naught but wind and rain,
and the waves thunderin&rsquo; o&rsquo; th&rsquo; beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; then I knew he wur dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice, which had been lifted excitedly as she told her
tale, dropped at its close, and the hand, which had twitched
convulsively in mine, lay passive once more.&nbsp; It was an
eerie tale, but convincing withal, and my eyes again stole
towards the window nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think he had come again when I knocked
to-night, then?&rdquo; I inquired, after a pause.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen him or his spirit since the night
you told me of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, ma&rsquo;am, but I&rsquo;m all&rsquo;ays
waitin&rsquo; for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he will come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eh, I wish to the Lord he would coom.&nbsp; I am longing
for&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet when I looked in I thought you seemed&mdash;almost
frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afeared,&rdquo; she returned in a low voice,
&ldquo;but <a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>I&rsquo;m not afeard o&rsquo; him&mdash;I&rsquo;m
afeared o&rsquo; what he&rsquo;ll bring when he cooms.&nbsp; And
yet, God knows, I&rsquo;ll be fain to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, never mind.&nbsp; Maybe &rsquo;tis foolish talk. .
. .&nbsp; The rain has gived ower now, ma&rsquo;am, and
yo&rsquo;d happen do well to mak&rsquo; a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no disputing the advisability of this course, and I
took my leave, promising to come and see the old woman again on
my next visit to the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Two years passed, however, before I again found myself in that
part of the world, and even then I had been staying at Saltleigh
for a week or two before I could make time to betake myself to
the cottage on the lonely dunes.&nbsp; I walked along the shore
as I had done on that former occasion, and, as I drew near, my
eyes instinctively sought the little window which had played so
important a part in the old woman&rsquo;s story, and I stared in
surprise at its altered aspect.&nbsp; The ledge behind the
casement hitherto left blank&mdash;no doubt because Molly would
tolerate no intervening objects between her and the panes on
which her eyes loved to linger&mdash;was now closely packed with
flower pots; gay scarlet geraniums pressing forward to the
light.&nbsp; I quickened my steps, but before I could reach the
house a yet more astonishing sight appeared amid the clusters of
bloom; neither more or less than the laughing face of a little
child, which peered curiously out at me, and was by-and-by
supplemented by two fat, dimpled hands, which hammered gleefully
upon the glass.</p>
<p><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>Full
of forebodings I knocked at the cottage door, which was presently
opened by a tall young woman with a baby in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to see Molly Davis,&rdquo; I said
hesitatingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is she&mdash;is she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, ma&rsquo;am, hoo&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; returned the
young woman, answering my wistful look rather than the unfinished
sentence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hoo deed nigh upon a year ago&mdash;last
autumn it wur.&nbsp; Poor soul, hoo was glad to go, I doubt, for
hoo was but &rsquo;onely here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know&mdash;what she died of?&nbsp; Was she long
ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo seemed to be failin&rsquo; like, but hoo
wasn&rsquo;t not to say sick.&nbsp; Eh, it gived every one a turn
when they coom and found her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say they found her dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yigh, ma&rsquo;am, little Teddy down yon fro&rsquo;
Frith&rsquo;s farm coom up wi&rsquo; the milk&mdash;hoo
couldn&rsquo;t fotch it for hersel&rsquo; for two-three weeks
afore hoo died&mdash;he hommered at door and couldna get no
answer, and then he run round to window, and theer he found her,
poor body, leein&rsquo; close under it on her face.&nbsp; He ran
down to farm and they coom and brok&rsquo; oppen door and fotched
doctor, but doctor said hoo&rsquo;d been dead for mony hours. . .
.&nbsp; Dunnot tak&rsquo; on ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;&mdash;for I was
weeping&mdash;&ldquo;coom in and set yo&rsquo; down.&nbsp; I
doubt it giv&rsquo; yo&rsquo; a turn to hear o&rsquo; poor Molly
goin&rsquo; that way.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ll all ha&rsquo; to go
when we&rsquo;re turn cooms,&rdquo; she added
philosophically.</p>
<p>Wiping my eyes I went into the little kitchen which I
remembered so well; its aspect was changed and modernised.&nbsp;
A gay square of oil-cloth covered the tiled floor, the walls were
decked with gaudily <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>coloured pictures; Molly&rsquo;s
great elbow-chair was gone, and in its place stood a horsehair
covered sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, we&rsquo;s all ha&rsquo; to go when we&rsquo;re
turn cooms,&rdquo; repeated my new hostess with the gloomy
relish, with which your rustic enunciates such statements;
&ldquo;and Molly, hoo were fain to goo.&nbsp; Onybody could see
that as coom to see her laid out&mdash;so peaceful hoo looked,
wi&rsquo; a smile upon her face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was found under the window you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Her knittin&rsquo; wur throwed on the floor
nigh to her cheer, and hoo&rsquo;d knocked down a stool on the
way to the window&mdash;doctor said hoo&rsquo;d wanted to oppen
it and let in fresh air, very likely&mdash;for her arms were
stretched out towards it.&nbsp; But hoo didn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo;
time, poor soul, hoo was took afore hoo could get theer.&nbsp;
Eh, dear, yes.&nbsp; That was the very way they found her,
lyin&rsquo; on her face wi&rsquo; her arms stretched out, and
smilin&rsquo;&mdash;smilin&rsquo; quite joyful like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So there had been no fear at the last&mdash;no fear either of
Will himself or of the grim comrade who had accompanied
him.&nbsp; Molly&rsquo;s presentiment had been realised; the much
loved spirit of her husband had come to seek and sustain her in
the last solemn moment.&nbsp; Stormy youth and lonely middle-age
had alike been forgotten; for Molly the end had been peace.</p>
<p>And as I took my way homewards to the sound of the gentle
lapping waves, I thought of her, not as she had described herself
to me, handsome, wilful, impetuous; not as I had seen her,
expectant, regretful&mdash;not even starting forward at the sound
of <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>the
well-known signal, or lying prone with outstretched arms upon the
floor.&nbsp; No, I pictured to myself the placid face smiling on
the pillow, the folded hands at rest, every line of the quiet
figure bearing the imprint of a peace that would never more be
broken.</p>

277</span>APRIL FOOLS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late spring dusk had at length
fallen; the horses had been led home from the plough, which
remained in characteristic Dorset fashion at the angle of the
last furrow, the merciful twilight hiding the rich coating of
rust with which a lengthy course of such treatment had endued it;
the elder labourers had donned their coats, and lit their pipes,
and gone sauntering homewards along the dewy grass border of the
lane.&nbsp; Farmer Bellamy had laid aside his pinner&mdash;the
last cow having long been milked and sent pasturewards in the
rear of her fellows&mdash;and likewise smoked ruminatively in the
chimney corner; his wife faced him, a large basket at her feet
containing sundry arrears of mending, a sock upon her outspread
left hand, a needle threaded with coarse yarn in the other.&nbsp;
It was getting too dark to darn now, and she wondered impatiently
why Alice and Lizzie did not come in to light the lamp and do
their share of needlework.</p>
<p>But Mrs Bellamy&rsquo;s daughters formed part of a little
group of men and girls who had gathered round the low stone wall
at the extremity of the yard; the central point of interest being
a certain flat-topped gatepost which marked off the entrance to a
disused pig-sty.&nbsp; Lizzie Bellamy was bending over this, her
face in close proximity to the paper on which she was writing,
her eyes strained in the <a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>endeavour to make the most of such
light as yet remained.&nbsp; A boy, standing near her, held, at a
convenient angle, a penny ink-bottle which he obligingly tilted
each time that she required to dip her pen; occasionally in
Lizzie&rsquo;s increasing excitement, the pen missed its mark,
whereupon he seized it in his stumpy fingers and guided it to its
rightful destination.</p>
<p>Little spasmodic bursts of laughter escaped the writer every
now and then, and a kind of smothered chorus of giggles was kept
up by the bystanders; while from time to time one of the more
adventurous squinted over her shoulder, being admonished in
return by a vigorous dig from the girl&rsquo;s elbow.</p>
<p>At last she threw back her head and dropped her pen with a
laughing exclamation&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low that&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it, read it!&rdquo; cried the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;ll have to light a match, then,&rdquo;
retorted she.</p>
<p>Jem Frisby produced one, struck it on the wall, and stepped
forward.</p>
<p>The light fell on the girl&rsquo;s face&mdash;a good-looking
one enough, of the dark-eyed, red-cheeked Dorset type&mdash;and
illuminated now one, now another, of her companions.&nbsp; All
these faces were young, all bore the same expression of
expectant, mischievous glee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear
Giles</span>,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Lizzie, &ldquo;&lsquo;I take up
my pen to write these few lines to let you know a wish
what&rsquo;s long been in my mind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low it &rsquo;ud be better if
ye did put &lsquo;What&rsquo;s been in my mind since the death
o&rsquo; Missus Neale,&rsquo;&rdquo; suggested a tall lad, with a
smothered roar of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t do at all,&rdquo; said
Lizzie.&nbsp; &ldquo;It &rsquo;ud put him in mind o&rsquo; the
poor body, and he&rsquo;d be that down-hearted he wouldn&rsquo;t
have no fancy for cwortin&rsquo; Hannah.&nbsp; Keep quiet, else I
can&rsquo;t read.&nbsp; There, the match be out now; &rsquo;tis
your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the maid alone till she&rsquo;ve a-read us what
she&rsquo;ve a-wrote,&rdquo; growled somebody from the darkness,
which seemed intense now that the little flickering light had
vanished.&nbsp; Jem struck another match, and Lizzie continued,
reading quickly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must find it terr&rsquo;ble hard to manage
without no missus; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m beginning to feel lonesome
now I be gettin&rsquo; into years&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low that&rsquo;ll sp&rsquo;ile her
chances!&rdquo; exclaimed someone in the background.&nbsp; Lizzie
twisted her head round angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the kind; Giles &rsquo;ud never
look at nobody without it were a staid &rsquo;ooman.&nbsp; Second
match is near out now.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t be bothered
readin&rsquo; the letter to ye at all if ye keep on
a-interruptin&rsquo; of I.&nbsp; Well&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been a-thinkin&rsquo; we might do
worse nor make a match.&nbsp; I could do for you, and you&rsquo;d
be company for I.&nbsp; Besides&rsquo;&mdash;here Lizzie&rsquo;s
voice quavered with laughter&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve took a
mortal fancy to you, Giles, an&rsquo; think you the handsomest
man ever I see.&nbsp; My heart have been yours two year an&rsquo;
<a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>more.&nbsp; If you think well on the notion you might
meet me to-morrow in the Little Wood at breakfast
time.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Hannah
Pethin</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;As I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; a
bit timid along o&rsquo; writin&rsquo; this here letter,
I&rsquo;d be obliged if ye&rsquo;d kindly not mention it when we
meets face to face.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The match had burnt itself out a moment or two previously, but
Lizzie remembered her composition sufficiently well to recite it
without such aid, and was rewarded for the effort by shouts of
approving laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; exclaimed one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last touch is the best!&rdquo; cried another; while
all united in declaring the letter to be &ldquo;jist about
clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pop it under his door late to-night!&rdquo;
cried Jem.&nbsp; &ldquo;So soon as I&rsquo;m sure he be
asleep.&nbsp; Now, let&rsquo;s write his to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better do that,&rdquo; said Lizzie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The two writin&rsquo;s mustn&rsquo;t be the same,
an&rsquo; she&rsquo;d know my hand along o&rsquo; my makin&rsquo;
out the milk bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold the match, then, somebody,&rdquo; cried Jem.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here, &rsquo;Ector, catch hold; an&rsquo; mind ye keep it
studdy.&nbsp; Give me the pen, Liz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took up his position at the flat stone, and was so long in
squaring his elbows, arranging the pen in his clumsy fingers, and
thrusting his tongue into his cheek&mdash;a necessary preliminary
to rustic letter writing&mdash;that Hector announced that the
match was burning him, before he had begun work in earnest.</p>
<p><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>&ldquo;Hold hard a minute!&rdquo; cried another
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Best be thinkin&rsquo; out what you want to say
afore we lights another.&nbsp; It comes terr&rsquo;ble expensive
on matches, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s enough to put anybody off to
have to start to light one in the middle of a line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true!&rdquo; agreed the others.</p>
<p>Lizzie, flushed with her recent triumph, again took the
lead&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Hannah</span>&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best put &lsquo;Miss Pethin&rsquo;&rdquo; suggested
Rose Gillingham, one of the dairymaids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He do never call her anything but Hannah,&rdquo;
retorted Lizzie; &ldquo;an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ve been
workin&rsquo; together now for nigh upon ten year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very reason she&rsquo;ll think
he&rsquo;s more in earnest-like; she&rsquo;ll be terr&rsquo;ble
pleased if he treats her so respectful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something in that, the others agreed, and even
Lizzie gave way, and it was decided that the amorous document
should begin after the somewhat distant fashion suggested by
Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; resumed Lizzie&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;I
write these few lines to say as I&rsquo;ve been a-turnin&rsquo;
over somethin&rsquo; in my mind, as I hope you&rsquo;ll be glad
to hear.&nbsp; Bein&rsquo; a widow-man, I feels mysel&rsquo; by
times at a terr&rsquo;ble loss, an&rsquo; I be wishful to take a
second&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bain&rsquo;t that comin&rsquo; to the p&rsquo;int a bit
too quick?&rdquo; interrupted Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, no!&rdquo; interpolated Jem very quickly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mercy me, it&rsquo;ll take I all my time to get that <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>much
in.&nbsp; We have but the one sheet of paper, look see; an&rsquo;
there&rsquo;ll be a deal o&rsquo; writin&rsquo; in what
ye&rsquo;ve thought on a&rsquo;ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nobody,&rsquo;&rdquo; went on
Lizzie, disregarding both disputants, &ldquo;&lsquo;my dear Miss
Pethin, what I could like better to fill the empty post nor
yourself&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knowed a post could be empty,&rdquo; said some
facetious bystander, who was, however, nudged and hushed into
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do think you the vittiest maid in the whole
o&rsquo; Dorset,&rsquo;&rdquo; pursued the intrepid author, being
unable, however, to proceed with her composition for some
moments, owing to the storm of ironical applause; for, indeed,
the destined recipient of this tender document was not only
&ldquo;a staid &rsquo;ooman,&rdquo; but had never, at any period
of her life, possessed any claim to good looks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If ye think well on my offer, will ye meet I at
the Little Wood at breakfast-time to-morrow?&nbsp; But, as
I&rsquo;m a shy man by natur&rsquo;, I&rsquo;d thank ye not to
say nothin&rsquo; about me havin&rsquo; wrote to ye.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;&lsquo;Your true and
faithful,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Giles Neale</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the hubbub of applause had subsided, a match was duly
lighted, and Jem set to work.&nbsp; His task concluded, after
much labour and consequent burning of matches, the document was
read aloud, directed, and handed over to Lizzie, who undertook to
slip it under Hannah&rsquo;s door before retiring to rest
herself.</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>&ldquo;If she do say anythin&rsquo; to I about it,
I&rsquo;ll tell her I did hear a man&rsquo;s foot goin&rsquo;
through the cheese-room very late,&rdquo; she added,
giggling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, us&rsquo;ll all post ourselves behind the
hedge at back o&rsquo; the Little Wood,&rdquo; cried Rose,
jubilantly; &ldquo;an&rsquo; then us&rsquo;ll all run out
an&rsquo; call &lsquo;April Fools!&rsquo; so soon as
they&rsquo;ve a-made it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rdquo; agreed Lizzie, &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t you sp&rsquo;ile sport by runnin&rsquo; out too
soon.&nbsp; Best wait till brewery whooter goes, an&rsquo; then
all run out together&mdash;that&rsquo;s the ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The resolution was carried unanimously, and the party
separated for the night.&nbsp; The female section made its way
towards the farmhouse, for the two milkmaids employed by Farmer
Bellamy in addition to his own stalwart daughters, lodged on the
premises; while the men and boys betook themselves to the little
cluster of houses, a kind of off-shoot from the village proper,
in which they had their homes.</p>
<p>Hannah Pethin was usually the first of that busy household to
awake, and it was her duty to call her less alert
companions.&nbsp; When, on the morning of this momentous first of
April, she jumped out of bed, she stood for a moment or two
rubbing her eyes and staring.&nbsp; There, in the centre of the
very small patch of boarded floor which intervened between her
bed and the door, lay a large white envelope, which bore her name
in bold characters&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Miss
Hannah Pethin</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for me,&rdquo; she said to herself, after
gazing at this object for a minute or two.&nbsp; It generally
took <a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>Hannah some little time to grasp an idea, but this one
presented itself in a concrete form.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear, to be
sure, I wonder what anyone can be writin&rsquo; to me
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had pulled on her stout knitted stockings, and assumed the
greater part of her underwear, before it occurred to her to open
the letter and ascertain its contents.&nbsp; Even then she
grasped the paper with a diffident finger and thumb, and turned
it over and over before she could make up her mind to embark on
its perusal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; she exclaimed, looking at the end in true
feminine fashion, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis from Giles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes opened wider and wider as she read the line which
preceded the signature.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your true and
faithful.&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned over the page, the colour
deepening in a countenance already ruddy as the brick floor of
the milk-house which she so frequently scrubbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she ejaculated at last, drawing a long
breath, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a offer&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it
be!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; thought o&rsquo; me gettin&rsquo;
a offer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She mused for a little time, her face wreathed in smiles, and
spelt over the letter again with increasing satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Meet I at the Little Wood at breakfast-time
to-morrow</i>&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Hannah&rsquo;s wits were brightening under the influence of this
unexpected stroke of good fortune.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d
thank ye not to say nothin&rsquo; about me havin&rsquo;
wrote.&rsquo;. . .&nbsp; Well, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s well
thought on.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I be jist so shy as he,
an&rsquo; it &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; been terr&rsquo;ble arkward to
ha&rsquo; talked about sich a letter as this here. . . .&nbsp;
&lsquo;I be wishful to <a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>take a second&rsquo;&mdash;well, the
man couldn&rsquo;t speak plainer. . . .&nbsp; &lsquo;The vittiest
maid!&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>Fancy</i> him sayin&rsquo; that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this period of her meditations Hannah was constrained to
cross the room on tip-toe to the window, near which a small
square looking-glass was suspended from a nail.&nbsp; She
surveyed her own image with some curiosity but no little
satisfaction, as with Giles&rsquo;s eyes; regretted that her hair
was growing grey about the temples, but consoled herself with the
fact that it was still abundant and curly, and finally smiled
broadly to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low if I do for him it&rsquo;s all
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she recollected with a start that if she was to be at
the tryst at the hour named, she would have to get through her
intervening labours with more than usual celerity.</p>
<p>A few minutes later a whirlwind-like form burst into the room
where Lizzie and Alice Bellamy still lay, wrapped in slumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, &rsquo;tis past the time, an&rsquo;
there&rsquo;s a deal to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie sat up, at first very cross, but recovering good humour
as recollection came with increasing consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Hannah, wait a bit, what be in sich a stew
for?&rdquo;&nbsp; She poked Alice, who still lay under the
blankets, with her elbow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have anythin&rsquo;
strange happened?&nbsp; You do look so queer&mdash;an&rsquo; I do
declare you&rsquo;ve a-made yourself quite smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense!&rdquo; responded Hannah quickly,
&ldquo;What could ha&rsquo; happened at this time <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>o&rsquo;
marnin&rsquo;?&nbsp; I be in a hurry to get forward wi&rsquo; my
work, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that all?&nbsp; We slept a bit late, Alice
an&rsquo; me, along o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; disturbed by
hearin&rsquo; a man&rsquo;s steps i&rsquo; the cheese-room late
last night; did you chance to hear &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She poked the sleepy Alice again, and even through her
half-closed lids that damsel perceived the conscious expression
which overspread poor Hannah&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Before they had
time, however, to ply her with further queries the latter had
fled from the room, and after a vigorous thump or two on the door
of the room shared by her fellow milkmaids, and a more respectful
summons to the farmer and his wife, went hammering downstairs in
her hobnailed boots to begin her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She bain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to be late at the
meetin&rsquo; place ye mid be sure!&rdquo; cried Lizzie, and
Alice roused herself sufficiently to chuckle.</p>
<p>The feverish zeal with which Hannah subsequently applied
herself to her various duties astonished her mistress, who was
wont to consider her unduly slow of a morning.&nbsp; This zeal,
however, seemed to be shared by the other occupants of the
farmhouse&mdash;no one who was in the secret wanted to be late;
everyone was determined to arrive at the Little Wood in time to
witness the meeting of the unconscious couple.&nbsp; At
breakfast-time, therefore, the yard was practically deserted, and
the plotters were safely ensconsed behind the thick quickset
hedge which bounded the little copse, and commanded a good view
of the gap through which the lovers must enter.</p>
<p><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>&ldquo;I knowed she&rsquo;d be first!&rdquo; cried
Lizzie, with a giggle, as Hannah&rsquo;s square figure came in
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ve a-got a red ribbon under her
collar,&rdquo; whispered Alice, &ldquo;Look how she&rsquo;ve
a-done herself up!&nbsp; She&rsquo;ve curled her hair I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, her hair curls na&rsquo;trel.&nbsp; Giles
&rsquo;ull think hisself in luck,&rdquo; cried Jem, with a
wink.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, I&rsquo;ve half a mind to try and cut
en out if he don&rsquo;t turn up soon.&nbsp; She <i>be</i> a
vitty maid, jist about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The vittiest maid in the whole o&rsquo;
Darset!&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted his neighbour.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Hannah slowly approached, a maidenly shyness
checking her too eager feet.&nbsp; It would be more seemly for
Giles to be there before her, she had thought, and she had not
started till five minutes past eight by the cuckoo clock.&nbsp;
He was probably already in the wood, looking at her.&nbsp; She
reddened at the thought and tripped in the long grass, recovering
herself with an awkward lurch.&nbsp; But there was a bright
colour in her cheeks, and a pleasantly expectant light in her
eyes, perceiving which, the onlookers nudged each other.</p>
<p>Passing through the gap Hannah gave one quick glance round,
and finding that Giles was not there, stood for a moment with a
look of blank disappointment, then, as the church clock struck
eight she smiled to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low farm clock be fast,&rdquo; she
remarked aloud, and forthwith, deeming herself to be alone,
devoted herself to the improvement of her appearance.&nbsp; She
shook out her skirts, took off and retied the bow of red ribbon;
passed the loosened locks about her brow round her toil-worn
finger, and finally, shading her <a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>eyes with her hand, gazed somewhat
anxiously in the direction of the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he be!&rdquo; whispered Jem all at once.&nbsp; He
had crawled a little way on his stomach in order to obtain a
better view.</p>
<p>Hannah, perceiving Giles at the same moment, modestly withdrew
from the gap, and sitting down at the foot of a twisted
thorn-tree began nervously to pluck and chew the scarcely
unfolded leaves of wood sorrel which grew beneath it.&nbsp; The
heavy tread drew nearer, and presently Giles&rsquo; figure
appeared in the gap.</p>
<p>Hannah looked up bashfully, a tentative smile hovering about
her lips.&nbsp; Giles smiled too, very broadly, and stood
contemplating her so long that the interested waiters craned
their heads in the endeavour to ascertain the cause of the
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be jist a-lookin&rsquo; at her,&rdquo; muttered
Alice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; she be a lookin&rsquo; up at he this
way,&rdquo; responded Lizzie, with a leer which was a malicious
exaggeration of poor Hannah&rsquo;s uncertain smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you be a-settin&rsquo; on the ground?&rdquo;
hazarded Giles at last.</p>
<p>He squeezed himself through the gap and came a step
nearer.&nbsp; He was a thick-set man, with a broad,
good-humoured, stupid face, which was now all creased and
puckered with an odd expression that partook as much of anxiety
as pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bain&rsquo;t ye afeared o&rsquo; catchin&rsquo;
cold?&rdquo; he pursued, illuminated by a sudden idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get up if you like,&rdquo; stammered
Hannah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now,&rdquo; said Giles, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
as I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>He
grinned till his eyes positively disappeared as he lowered
himself to the ground beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>Hannah was at a loss to answer, and, after a moment&rsquo;s
pause, he thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out a large
hunch of bread and cheese</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best make the most of our time,&rdquo; he
remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;m ploughin&rsquo; to-day.&nbsp;
Hain&rsquo;t you brought your breakfast?&rdquo; he asked, pausing
in the midst of mastication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think about breakfast,&rdquo; faltered
Hannah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t ye now?&rdquo; said Giles.</p>
<p>He looked reflectively at his portion, and then, apparently
deciding that there was only enough for one, continued to dispose
of it, albeit with an uneasy and apologetic air.&nbsp; The
silence that ensued was so long that the onlookers began to
exchange glances somewhat blankly.&nbsp; It would be dull if
Giles merely ate his breakfast while Hannah sat by&mdash;that was
an everyday occurrence.&nbsp; Presently, however, Hannah took the
initiative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Neale,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;did you want to speak
to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giles, with a large lump of bread in his cheek, turned upon
her a glance that was half alarmed and half humorous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I be come,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;B&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t that enough?&nbsp; Deeds an&rsquo; not
words is my motto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, an&rsquo; I be come,&rdquo; said Hannah, with
some spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be come because I did think ye mid
ha&rsquo; summat to say to I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giles looked at her knowingly, and remarked with a meaning
jerk of his head&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low us do understand each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannah, pleased but still uncertain, laughed feebly, and began
to pleat the hem of her immaculate white apron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t never expect nobody to be carryin&rsquo;
on about my bein&rsquo; a vitty maid,&rdquo; she said presently,
in a low voice&mdash;not so low, however, but that she was
overheard by the delighted spies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Giles heartily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye
wouldn&rsquo;t be like to expect that&mdash;no, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannah was taken aback for the moment, but remembering
Giles&rsquo; shyness, thought his unwillingness to pursue the
complimentary vein which had so much astonished her in his
letter, was due to that, and forebore to be offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true ye must feel yerself by times at a
terr&rsquo;ble loss,&rdquo; she continued after a pause.</p>
<p>Giles reflected&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t got on so bad so far,&rdquo; he
observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, I haven&rsquo;t got on so bad.&nbsp;
But I don&rsquo;t say&mdash;&rdquo; here he gulped down a huge
morsel and his natural timidity at the same time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t say as I shouldn&rsquo;t get on better
wi&rsquo; a &rsquo;ooman to do for me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say as
I shouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say no fairer than
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and then, with a leer that was distinctly amorous,
edged himself a little nearer to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seein&rsquo;
as some folks as needn&rsquo;t be mentioned have a-took a fancy
to I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, Mr Neale,&rdquo; interrupted Hannah coyly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatever did put sich a notion into your head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Giles fixed his twinkling eyes upon her <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>with a
glance that was unutterably knowing, and returned&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye wouldn&rsquo;t be here if ye hadn&rsquo;t, would ye
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannah gave an assenting giggle, and Giles, after a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, put his arm round her waist, repeating
exultantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would ye now?&nbsp; Not that I ever set up to be a
handsome man, ye know,&rdquo; he added more seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Handsome is as handsome does,&rdquo; exclaimed Hannah,
in so heart-whole a fashion that Giles did not ask himself if the
compliment were somewhat left-handed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if your &rsquo;eart&rsquo;s mine, that&rsquo;s
enough,&rdquo; went on Giles, after an interval devoted to
conscientious endeavours to recall the exact wording of the
portentous letter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
willin&rsquo;&mdash;there, ye have it plain.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
willin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hannah, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
I&rsquo;m very thankful to ye, Giles.&nbsp; I be proud to think
as I be your ch&rsquo;ice, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll do my very best
for to make ye comfortable an&rsquo; happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giles, pleasantly conscious that this courtship, unlooked for
though it might have been, was progressing on lines that were
eminently orthodox and satisfactory, eyed her approvingly for
some moments, and then, with a burst of enthusiasm, tightened his
grip of her solid waist, and exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I be &rsquo;appy an&rsquo;
comfortable now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the subsequent pause Jem Frisby thrust his sunburnt
face between the catkin-tipped willow saplings which protruded
from his corner of the <a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>hedge, and almost choked with
laughter as he announced&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be a-kissin&rsquo; of each other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The middle-aged lovers sat on for some time in extreme
enjoyment of the situation.&nbsp; The spring sunshine fell across
their knees and their sturdy clasped hands; the birds sang over
their heads, the twisted boughs of the old thorn waved in the
light breeze, the leaf-buds, already green though not yet
unfolded, flashing like jewels in the light.&nbsp; The bank
beneath the hedge was gay with celandines, and the air was sweet
with the scent of primroses, with which the place was carpeted,
though few of the flowers were yet in full bloom.</p>
<p>Giles and Hannah were scarcely conscious of their
surroundings, yet in some indefinite way these added to their
blissful state.&nbsp; Just as Giles, with that twinkle in his
eyes which heralded, as Hannah had perceived, some particularly
ardent speech, had nudged her meaningly and enquired &ldquo;What
about bein&rsquo; called home,&rdquo; the church clock struck
nine, and at the same time the blare of the brewery
&ldquo;whooter&rdquo; fell upon their ears.&nbsp; Simultaneously
with these sounds, others, even more discordant than the hooter
startled the pair, who scrambled to their feet in time to see a
row of gesticulating figures surmounted by grinning faces, spring
up from behind the hedge, which they had believed to shelter
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;April fools, haw, haw!&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low ye be a proper pair on &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;April fool, Hannah!&nbsp; Giles, ye be an April
fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>&ldquo;We took in the pair o&rsquo; ye
nicely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the chorus which greeted their bewildered ears,
interspersed with shouts of laughter, while fingers were pointed
and heads were shaken waggishly.&nbsp; Giles was the first to
recover his self-possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be the meanin&rsquo; o&rsquo; this?&rdquo; he
enquired angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad if a man
can&rsquo;t step out to have a quiet word wi&rsquo; a
&rsquo;ooman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More particular when the &rsquo;ooman&rsquo;s took sich
a mortal fancy to &rsquo;en!&rdquo; interpolated Lizzie, holding
her sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Alice, quick to take up her
cue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, Hannah&rsquo;s heart have a-been yours two
year an&rsquo; more.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t wonder at
it,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;Sich a &rsquo;andsome man as you
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been a-tellin&rsquo; ye about that?&rdquo;
growled Giles, turning very red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Hannah!&rdquo; ejaculated Lizzie, in a voice that
was scarcely articulate for laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ask the
vittiest maid in the whole o&rsquo; Darset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giles,&rdquo; exclaimed Hannah tremulously,
&ldquo;somebody must ha&rsquo; read your letter to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jeers and laughter redoubled, and Jem exclaimed
triumphantly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody read it, an&rsquo; somebody wrote
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it Giles?&rdquo; faltered Hannah, turning
pale beneath her tan, and beginning to tremble violently.&nbsp;
Some instinct of womanly compassion suddenly sobered Alice.&nbsp;
Pushing through the hedge she made her way to Hannah&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas but a joke, my dear,&rdquo; she explained
somewhat shamefacedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, &rsquo;tis the first
of April, <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>ye see, an&rsquo; we jist thought we&rsquo;d play ye a
bit of trick.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas made up jist for fun.&nbsp; We
wrote Giles a letter in your name asking him to meet ye here
an&rsquo; sayin&rsquo;&mdash;sayin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did ye say?&rdquo; interrupted Hannah, the colour
rushing back to her shamed, distressed face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Mr
Neale, you thought it was me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d never ha&rsquo;
wrote no letter, I&rsquo;d never ha&rsquo; been so bold.&nbsp;
I&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; come here wi&rsquo;out I
thought &rsquo;twas you as axed me.&nbsp; I had a letter this
marnin&rsquo; signed in your name.&nbsp; I thought &rsquo;twas
from you&mdash;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Breaking off
suddenly she raised her apron to her eyes.</p>
<p>Giles made a step towards her, pushed Alice roughly on one
side, and jerked the apron down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give over cryin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he exclaimed
gruffly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get at the rights o&rsquo;
this.&nbsp; I must have a look at that there letter&mdash;give it
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d never have the face,&rdquo; Hannah was
beginning when he silenced her with the reiterated command in a
raised voice&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to me, I say!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; the
rights o&rsquo; this&mdash;dalled if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very reluctantly Hannah drew the fateful missive from her
bosom, a suppressed titter once more breaking the silence which
had reigned since the jest had threatened to take a serious
turn.&nbsp; Giles unfolded the letter, read it slowly, and then,
with an impassive face, handed it back to its original
recipient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can keep it,&rdquo; he remarked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my letter right enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>&ldquo;Well, that is a good &rsquo;un!&rdquo; exclaimed
the irrepressible Jem.</p>
<p>Giles glowered round at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my letter,&rdquo; he repeated
doggedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my name what&rsquo;s signed at
the end, an&rsquo; every word what&rsquo;s in it be
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giles!&rdquo; exclaimed Hannah, almost
inarticulately.&nbsp; Giles turned majestically towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right, I tell &rsquo;ee,&rdquo; he said
firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a great hand at
letter-writin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; as like as not if I&rsquo;d
ha&rsquo; tried for to put down what be in my mind I
shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; done it so clever.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m much
obliged to you, neighbours,&rdquo; he added, raising his voice,
and looking triumphantly round at the astonished faces.&nbsp;
Then, with a sudden shout of laughter he exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s April fools now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there, I&rsquo;ll say you have the best o&rsquo;
it, Giles,&rdquo; said somebody good-humouredly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
be right down glad the matter be going to end this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye,&rdquo; said Giles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We be to wish ye j&rsquo;y, be we?&rdquo; said Lizzie,
with a scarcely perceptible toss of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low ye be,&rdquo; he affirmed
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I be pure glad, Hannah, my dear, I&rsquo;m
sure,&rdquo; said Alice, smiling doubtfully at Hannah as she
backed through the hedge.</p>
<p>Hannah made no response; she, too, was looking doubtful,
almost piteous, as she gazed at Giles&rsquo; unmoved
countenance.</p>
<p>The company filed away, feeling somewhat flat; the joke had
unaccountably missed fire.&nbsp; <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>Jem, who was the last to pass
through the gap, made a final attempt to put Giles out of
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis easy seen you be a man o&rsquo; taste,
Giles,&rdquo; he called out.&nbsp; &ldquo;She be the vittiest
maid in the whole o&rsquo; Darset, bain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She be,&rdquo; assented Giles with fervour, &ldquo;jist
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode towards the hedge, and stood watching the somewhat
depressed-looking little procession which filed across the
field.&nbsp; When it had disappeared behind the big hayrick at
the corner, he turned to Hannah.&nbsp; She had again thrown her
apron over her head, and was weeping behind it.&nbsp; He went
towards her and pulled it down&mdash;very gently this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have the best of it, I think,&rdquo; he
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Giles,&rdquo; sobbed she.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must
think&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know what you must
think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think what&rsquo;s wrote in my letter,&rdquo; said
Giles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now, you couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Hannah, but
there was an unconscious appeal in her voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
couldn&rsquo;t ever think I was a vitty maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you think I be a &rsquo;andsome man,
my dear?&rdquo; cried Giles, advancing, his broad face beaming
with good-humoured smiles towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, indeed I do,&rdquo; cried Hannah with eager
enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, I do think ye be the handsomest
and nicest man ever I did see.&nbsp; Handsome is as handsome
does.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low you&rsquo;ve acted
handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>&ldquo;Well, if you think so, I&rsquo;m
satisfied,&rdquo; responded Giles; then, after a pause, he added
with his most knowing twinkle&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we agree so well I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low we mid
jist so well fall over pulpit at once.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
